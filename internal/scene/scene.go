// Package scene provides the retained node storage of gift.
//
// # Why indices instead of pointers
//
// Nodes live in a small number of large, reused blocks and are referenced by a
// [Handle], not by a pointer. That keeps the tree in a handful of contiguous
// allocations, makes recycling cheap and keeps the garbage collector out of
// the frame path. The price is that a handle can outlive the node it refers
// to, which is why every handle carries a generation; see [Handle].
//
// The blocks are never copied when the store grows: growing appends one more
// block instead of reallocating one big slice. That is what makes the pointer
// returned by [Store.Get], and therefore the pointer to the inline payload,
// stable for the whole lifetime of a slot. The reconciler relies on it: it
// holds the payload of a parent while it allocates the nodes of its children.
//
// # The payload is inline and is not cleared
//
// [Node] carries its payload by value, not behind an interface. A tree of
// N nodes therefore costs N node structs inside the blocks and not N separate
// heap objects, and reading the payload needs no type assertion.
//
// [Store.Free] deliberately does *not* zero the payload. Everything a payload
// keeps that the garbage collector must not retain has to be released by the
// owner before the node is freed; in exchange, the slices a payload holds keep
// their backing arrays and a remount into a recycled slot allocates nothing.
// That is the whole point of the arrangement: unmounting a subtree must not
// feed the collector, and remounting it must not ask for memory back. See the
// project plan, sections 10 and 13.
//
// # Contract
//
// This package knows nothing about views, state or rendering. It only knows
// parent and sibling links, the layout results and a payload whose type the
// module root chooses through the type parameter. It must never import the
// module root.
//
// A Store is not safe for concurrent use. It belongs to the UI executor.
