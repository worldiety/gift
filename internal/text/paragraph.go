// Glyph is one positioned glyph of a shaped run.
//
// The position is relative to the origin of the [Line] the glyph belongs to:
// X grows to the right from the left edge of the line, Y grows downwards from
// the baseline of the line. A renderer draws the glyph at
//
//	lineOriginX + g.X, line.Baseline + g.Y
//
// with no further arithmetic and, crucially, without shaping anything again.
//
// X and Y are whole pixels. The project plan, section 7, rules out subpixel
// positioning, and the rounding happens here rather than in the backend so
// that measurement sees the same numbers the rasteriser will: a width that is
// computed from unrounded pen positions and drawn from rounded ones is the
// classic off by a pixel at the end of a long line.

	X float32

	// glyph off the baseline, for instance for a mark attachment.
	Y float32
	// Advance is the horizontal advance the shaper assigned to this glyph,
	// including any kerning adjustment. It is not rounded and is therefore
	// not, in general, the difference between two consecutive X values.
	Advance float32
	// Cluster is the index of the first byte in Request.Text that this glyph
	// belongs to. Several glyphs can share a cluster (one rune decomposed) and
	// one glyph can cover several runes (a ligature). The values are non
	// decreasing within a run, because this package never reorders anything;
	// see the package documentation on bidi.

// Run is a sequence of glyphs from a single font.
//
// There is exactly one run per non empty line today, because a [Request] names
// exactly one font. The type exists anyway so that the addition of a font
// fallback chain, which the project plan, section 7, names as the most likely
// first extension, changes which runs are produced and not what a consumer has
// to look at.

// Line is one visual line of a [Paragraph].
type Line struct {
	// Baseline is the distance from the top of the paragraph to the baseline
	// of this line, in whole pixels. Baselines are an arithmetic progression:
	// line n sits at Metrics.FirstBaseline + n*Metrics.LineHeight.
	Baseline float32
	// Width is the honest advance width of the line, excluding trimmed
	// trailing whitespace. It may exceed the width limit of the request; see
	// [Paragraph.Overflow].
	Width float32
	// Advance is the advance width of the line *including* the trailing
	// whitespace Width leaves out.
	//
	// The two differ only for a line that ends in spaces, and then they
	// differ for a good reason on both sides: a label that happens to end in
	// a space must not be wider than the text it shows, which is Width, and a
	// caret placed after that space must not sit on top of the character
	// before it, which is this. Everything that measures wants Width;
	// everything that maps a byte offset to an x coordinate wants Advance for
	// the offset at the end of the line, because there is no glyph there to
	// read a position from.
	//
	// It is a field and not a sum a caller can compute, because the advances
	// of exactly those trailing glyphs are zeroed in the glyph list; see the
	// trimming in the shaper. Without it the information does not exist
	// outside this package at all, and a text field would have to re-shape
	// the string to recover it.

	// A single word that is longer than the limit is *not* broken, hyphenated,
	// scaled or truncated: it keeps its honest width, the line reports that
	// width, and the excess appears here. This is the text form of the
	// overflow model of the project plan, section 7: content that does not fit
	// stays visible and the amount by which it does not fit is a number
	// somebody can read, rather than a silent collapse or a silent ellipsis.
	// A caller who wants the excess cut off clips it, explicitly, in the
	// layer that owns the clip stack, or asks for an ellipsis by name with
	// [Request.Truncation] — and then the amount moves to Hidden, where it is
	// still a number, rather than disappearing.
	Overflow float32

	// Hidden is how much of the honest extent of the text this paragraph
	// does not show because [Request.MaxLines] or [Request.Truncation] took
	// it away. It is zero for a request with neither.
	//
	// H is the height of the lines past MaxLines: their count times
	// Metrics.LineHeight, which is exactly the difference between the height
	// of the whole text and the height of this paragraph. W is how far the
	// last visible line, as it was broken before an ellipsis replaced its
	// tail, was wider than the width limit; it is zero for a line that was
	// shortened only because lines after it were dropped.
	//
	// It is a number and not a flag because of the overflow model of the
	// project plan, section 7: an ellipsis is a visible mark, but what it
	// stands for is content that does not fit, and ui reports that amount
	// through gift.Diagnostics like any other overflow. See [Truncation].

	// becomes empty.
	//
	// A line that carries an ellipsis covers, in Start and End, everything
