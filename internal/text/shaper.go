	// U+2028 and U+2029. "a\n" and "a\r" are both two lines, the second of
	// them empty. See [paragraphs] for why that is spelled out here rather
	// than left to the segmenter of the line wrapper.

	// and is quantised to 1/64 pixel, the resolution the shaper works in.
	Size float32
	// MaxWidth is the width limit for line breaking, in pixels. Use
	// [geom.Unbounded] to lay the text out on a single line regardless of its
	// width. A limit of zero is legal and means every word overflows.
	//
	// The limit is a *break* limit, not a clamp: a word that does not fit is
	// not broken, and the resulting line is wider than MaxWidth. See
	// [Paragraph.Overflow].
	MaxWidth float32
	// MaxLines limits the paragraph to its first n visual lines. Zero or
	// less, the default, means no limit.
	//
	// It is part of the request and not something a caller does to the
	// result, because of Truncation below: an ellipsis changes the glyphs of
	// the last line, and glyphs are this package's business. A caller that
	// dropped lines itself could only ever cut hard. The price of that is a
	// separate cache entry per limit, which costs nothing in practice — a
	// label is shown with one limit, not with several.
	MaxLines int
	// Truncation selects what happens to the last visible line when the
	// text does not fit: when MaxLines dropped lines after it, or when it is
	// itself wider than MaxWidth. The zero value, [TruncateNone], cuts hard
	// and leaves the last line as it was; see [Truncation] for the others.
	//
	// Truncation never applies to any line but the last visible one. A word
	// wider than the limit on an earlier line keeps overflowing honestly,
	// because an ellipsis in the middle of a paragraph would claim the text
	// continues somewhere it does not.

// [Paragraph] is shortened with an ellipsis when the text does not fit.

//
// Because the ellipsis has to be part of the one shaping result that measuring
// and drawing share; see "One shaping result, used twice" in the package
// documentation. A painter that drew "..." after a hard cut would place a
// glyph at a position no measurement ever saw, and a layout that measured the
// cut text without it would report a width nothing draws. Here the elided line
// is an ordinary [Line]: its width is the sum of the advances of the glyphs it
// really has, the ellipsis included.
//
// # What is hidden is still reported
//
// The project plan, section 7, forbids content that does not fit from
// disappearing quietly, and an ellipsis is a visible mark but not a number.
// [Paragraph.Hidden] carries the number, and ui reports it as overflow exactly
// as it did for the hard cut that came before this type.
