// paintKids paints a run of children of the current node under the clip the

//
// # Why the clip is here and not in the widget
//
// [Element.Clip] used to mean two different things in two different places.
// gift read it for hit testing, and a widget was separately expected to call
// [PaintContext.PushClip] around its children. ui.Stack and ui.Text did;
// ui.Button did not, so a 400x400 label inside a 50x50 button with Clip(true)
// painted over the whole window while its own documentation promised the
// opposite, and the input half agreed with the documentation rather than with
// the pixels. Two readers of one declaration, and nothing making them agree.
//
// Now there is one reader. The flag is applied here, on the way into the
// subtree, which is the one route every container's children take:
// [PaintContext.PaintChildren] and [PaintContext.PaintChild] are the only ways
// a painter can descend, and a node with no painter at all goes through
// [App.paintNode], which applies the same clip for the same reason. A widget
// cannot forget it, because there is nothing left for a widget to do.
//
// # What stays outside
//
// The clip surrounds the children and not the node's own drawing. That is the
// order the project plan, section 8, fixes and ui_test pins: a background is
// exactly the bounds and a border lies inside them, so clipping either would
// be a no-op, but a *shadow* deliberately extends past the bounds and clipping
// it to them would delete it. A node's own ops are therefore emitted under
// whatever clip its parent established, and only the subtree is confined.
//
// # Leaves
//
// A view whose content is not its children — [ui.Text] draws glyphs — has no
// children to route and applies the clip around its own content itself. There
// is no shared path to put that on, because "content" for a leaf is whatever
// that leaf draws, and gift cannot tell it apart from the background.
//
// # Cost
//
// One bool test and one nil test per container per frame, and one clip stack
// entry plus one transform for the containers that asked for them. No
// allocation, so the frame path contract of the project plan, section 11, is
// unaffected.

// beginSubtree applies everything a node imposes on the way into its subtree:
// its [Element.Clip] and, for a scroll container, the translation of its
// scroll offset. endSubtree undoes it.
//
// # One reader, two callers, no drift
//
// There are exactly two routes into a subtree — [PaintContext.paintKids] for a
// node that has a painter and the nil painter branch of [App.paintNode] for
// one that does not — and both go through here. [App.hitNode] does the same
// two things in the same order for input. That is the single reader rule
// [Element.Clip] already followed, extended to the scroll offset, and it is
// why a scrolled node cannot be drawn in one place and hit in another.
//
// # The clip is device space, and that is a bug fix
//
// The rectangle pushed here is the node's bounds mapped through the transform
// that is active for the node itself. It used to be the raw bounds, which was
// indistinguishable from the right answer for as long as every transform was
// the identity — and nothing ever set one, so nothing ever noticed. The first
// scroll container inside another one would have clipped its content against
// the rectangle it occupied before the outer container scrolled. The input
// half in [App.hitNode] already composed the transform, so the two halves
