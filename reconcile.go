//     flipped by a background task while its tab was off screen held the
//     device at full rate for 12 of 60 frames, and a caret enrolment survived
//     for its whole ten second window.
//   - the kinetic fling of [App.tickScrolls]. Measured: a fling in flight
//     when its tab was hidden ran for 140 of 600 frames, 2.24 seconds, and
//     moved the offset from 400 to 1395 document units — so the screen the

// subtree becomes hidden. An application with nothing animating pays three
// length checks.

// What it deliberately does not do is *remember* the enrolments so that they
// could be resumed when the subtree comes back. A fling that is resumed a
// minute later is a screen that scrolls by itself the moment the user returns
// to it, and an animation is a transition between two states that have both
