// draw call returns as soon as the command is queued; the driver executes it
// later and the backend presents the result later still. The project plan,

	// the frame has been presented.
	DrawCPU Stats

	// FrameInterval is the wall clock distance between the entry of two
	// consecutive draw callbacks. This is the series that answers "did we
	// hold sixty frames per second", because it contains everything the

	// as the backend's loop exposes them.

	// TargetInterval is their sum and is the value samples are actually

	// All three are carried in every snapshot because the project plan,
