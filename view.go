// View is a short lived description of a piece of user interface.
//
// A view is a value, not an object with identity. It is created during a
// build, consumed by the reconciler and then dropped. Durable identity lives
// in the scope and in the retained node tree, never in a copy of a view
// struct. Views are never evaluated in the frame hot path; see the project
// plan, sections 4 and 6.
type View interface {
	// ViewType returns the process wide stable ID of the concrete view type.
	//
	// Two views with different ViewType under the same key force a remount
	// instead of an update, which discards the node and the state below it.
	ViewType() TypeID

	// Build describes the element this view stands for. It is called during
	// reconciliation and never during paint.
	//
	// The returned Element is not retained beyond the call, except for the
	// children slice it references; see [Element.Children]. Build must be
	// free of side effects: the reconciler may call it before it has decided
	// whether the resulting element updates an existing node or mounts a new
	// one.
	Build(*BuildContext) Element
}

// Element is the description of one retained node.
//
// It is produced by [View.Build] and applied to a node by the reconciler.
type Element struct {
	// Key is the optional stable identity of this element among its
	// siblings. Siblings with keys are matched by key, siblings without keys
	// are matched by position. A key only has to be unique among siblings,
	// not globally.
	Key string

	// Label is the human readable text this node stands for.
	//
	// It is a *semantic* field, not a visual one: nothing in the layout or
	// the paint path reads it, and setting it changes no pixel. A view sets
	// it to whatever a person would call the node — [ui.Text] sets it to its
	// string, a [ui.Button] with an icon sets it to the name of the command
	// — so that something outside the frame path can find a node by what it
	// says rather than by where it happens to sit.
	//
	// Today the only consumer is the test harness in package gifttest, whose
	// ByText selector is the whole reason coordinate free UI tests are
	// possible. It is deliberately declared here on Element rather than as a
	// private field of one ui view, because the next two consumers are known
	// in advance and want exactly the same string: a button that wants an
	// accessible name distinct from its label view, and the accessibility
	// bridge the project plan, section 14, excludes from the MVP but does not
	// rule out forever.
	//
	// # Cost
	//
	// A string header, copied from the element onto the node during a build
	// and never touched again. A build already copies eight other fields out
	// of the same struct; this is a ninth, and it allocates nothing — the
	// bytes belong to the view, which owns them for as long as the node does.
	// Update, layout and paint never read it. See the allocation contract of
	// the project plan, section 11, and TestLabelCostsNothingPerFrame.
	Label string

	// Layouter measures this node and places its children. A nil Layouter
	// means the node has zero size and its children are neither measured nor
	// placed.
	Layouter Layouter

	// Painter emits the drawing operations of this node.
	//
	// A nil Painter draws nothing of its own and paints all children in
	// order. That is the fast path for a purely structural container: a
	// stack without background, border or clip has nothing to draw, and
	// making it invisible together with its whole subtree would be a trap
	// whose only symptom is a blank screen.
	//
	// A non nil Painter is fully responsible for its subtree: children are
	// drawn only where it calls [PaintContext.PaintChildren] or
	// [PaintContext.PaintChild], which is what makes the background,
	// content and border ordering explicit.
	Painter Painter

	// Children are the child views, in order.
	//
	// Ownership passes to gift on return. The caller must neither modify nor
	// reuse the slice afterwards. Whoever hands over a reused buffer must
	// copy first. A violation is detected in builds with the giftdebug tag;
	// see the project plan, section 4.
	Children []View

	// Flex is the flexibility of this element along the main axis of an
	// enclosing stack. Zero, the default, means inflexible: the element is
	// measured against the space that is left. A positive value means the
	// element takes a share of the remaining space proportional to it.
	//
	// It is a plain field rather than an interface or a type assertion in
	// the layout path on purpose: a stack recognises a [ui.Spacer] by
	// reading one float from the retained node, see
	// [LayoutContext.ChildFlex]. A layouter that is not a stack ignores it.
	Flex float32

	// Interactor makes this node a hit target for input. A nil Interactor,
	// the default, makes the node transparent to input without affecting its
	// children; see [Interactor] for why that polarity is the safe one.
	Interactor Interactor

	// Focusable declares that this node may hold the keyboard focus and
	// therefore takes part in the tab order. It is only honoured together
	// with a non nil Interactor: focus exists to deliver key events, and a
	// node that cannot receive them would be a black hole in the tab order.
	Focusable bool

	// Disabled takes the node out of input without taking it out of the
	// layout. A disabled node is still a hit target — so a click on it does
	// not fall through to whatever is behind it — but receives no events,
	// acquires no hover or press state and is skipped by the focus order.
	Disabled bool

	// Obstructs declares that this node covers part of the window on top of
	// the ordinary layout, so that [App.ScrollIntoView] keeps its target
	// clear of it.
	//
	// It exists for the on-screen keyboard of the project plan, section 19,
	// which is an overlay in a [ui.ZStack] and therefore takes no space away
	// from the form behind it. Without this flag a field revealed at the
	// bottom of a scrolling form would be revealed to a viewport the keyboard
	// is sitting on, which is the one failure the whole feature exists to
	// prevent.
	//
	// What it is not: it is not a safe area, not an inset system and not a
	// general occlusion model. Exactly one node can be the obstruction at a
	// time — the last *unhidden* one built wins — and the only reader is the
	// reveal. Layout, hit testing and painting ignore it completely. gift has
	// no second consumer for a larger idea and inventing one here would be
	// inventing it in the wrong place.
	//
	// "Unhidden" rather than simply "last" because a [ui.OnScreenKeyboard]
	// inside every tab of a [ui.TabBar] is an ordinary composition, and all
	// of them are built: without the qualification the obstruction would be
	// the keyboard of an *inactive* tab, and the reveal would push a focused
	// field up around a rectangle that is not on the screen. A node that
	// declares it and is inside a subtree that declared [Element.Hidden] is
	// not the obstruction, and one that becomes hidden while holding the
	// record gives it up; see [App.applyHidden].
	Obstructs bool

	// Clip confines this node's subtree to its bounds, for painting and for
	// input alike.
	//
	// It is one flag with one reader on each side, and both readers use this
	// node's bounds: [App.hitNode] intersects them into the inherited input
	// clip, and [PaintContext.PaintChildren] pushes them onto the display
	// list's clip stack on the way into the subtree. A widget therefore
	// cannot clip input without clipping paint or the other way round, which
	// is exactly what ui.Button used to do — Clip(true) confined its hit area
	// and let a 400x400 label paint over the window.
	//
	// The clip surrounds the subtree and not the node's own drawing, so a
	// shadow still extends past the bounds and a background still covers
	// them; see [PaintContext.paintKids]. A leaf whose content is not its
	// children has to apply the clip to that content itself, and ui.Text
	// does.
	//
	// Honest limitation: the clip is the bounding rectangle and not the
	// rounded shape, on both sides. A shape accurate clip needs stencil or
	// shader support and is a backend concern.
	Clip bool

	// Transform maps this node and its subtree into the space of its parent.
	// A nil Transform, the default, is the identity.
	//
	// It is shared between the two halves of a frame: [App.paintNode] pushes
	// it into the display list and [App.hitNode] composes the same matrix, so
	// input and output cannot disagree about where a node is. The project
	// plan, section 7, requires exactly that.
	//
	// The pointer is retained for as long as the node lives and must not be
	// modified afterwards; build a new one instead.
	//
	// It is a *build time* declaration, which is why scrolling does not use
	// it: a scroll offset changes without a rebuild, and gift would then have
	// to mutate a value the view owns. See [Element.Scroll].
	Transform *geom.Affine2D

	// Scroll declares this node to be a scroll viewport along one axis.
	//
	// A viewport clips its subtree to its own bounds and translates its
	// children by the scroll offset, which gift keeps in the retained node as
	// presentation state. Both halves are read exactly once, on the way into
	// the subtree, by [App.beginSubtree] for paint and by [App.hitNode] for
	// input — the same single reader rule [Element.Clip] follows, and for the
	// same reason.
	//
	// The translation deliberately applies to the children and not to the
	// node itself: the viewport has to stay where the layout put it, because
	// that is the rectangle it clips against. A node that also carries a
	// Transform composes normally, with its own transform applied first.
	//
	// gift installs its own [Interactor] on a scroll node that declares none,
	// which is what makes wheel, drag and kinetic scrolling work without a
	// view writing any gesture code. A nil Scroll, the default, is an
	// ordinary node.
	Scroll *ScrollSpec

	// Hidden takes this node and its whole subtree out of the frame without
	// taking it out of the tree.
	//
	// It is the mechanism navigation is built on. An inactive tab and a
	// screen that has been pushed over stay mounted — so their state, their
	// scroll offsets and their half typed text fields survive — and stop
	// costing anything per frame:
	//
	//   - [App.paintNode] returns immediately, so nothing in the subtree is
	//     drawn and no painter runs. gift has no paint culling of any kind,
	//     which is why this flag has to exist at all: without it every
	//     mounted node is painted every frame whether or not anybody can see
	//     it.
	//   - [App.hitNode] returns immediately, so nothing in the subtree is a
	//     pointer target. That includes a pointer that captured a node in the
	//     subtree *before* it was hidden: [App.applyHidden] drops the capture
	//     and tells the node its gesture was cancelled, because a captured
	//     pointer is otherwise delivered to unconditionally and a ui.Slider
	//     would go on writing the application's value from a finger moving
	//     over a screen it is not on.
	//   - [App.appendFocusable] skips the subtree, so nothing in it is in the
	//     tab order, and the focus is taken away from it in the build that
	//     hides it; see [App.applyHidden]. The node that held the focus is
	//     told so, after the build — not during it, because no application
	//     handler may run inside a reconciliation, and not never, because the
	//     handler is where a caret enrolment is cancelled. See pending.go.
	//   - the hover and the press look go the same way, and for the same
	//     reason they are on a descendant rather than on the node that
	//     carries this flag.
	//   - [App.ScrollIntoView] and [App.NodeVisibleBounds] both answer "not
	//     on screen", which is one answer and not two.
	//
	// What it deliberately does *not* do is skip build and layout. A hidden
	// subtree that nothing marked dirty is neither rebuilt nor measured
	// anyway — that is the three level invalidation of the project plan,
	// section 6 — and skipping the layout of one that *is* dirty would only
	// move the work to the frame in which it becomes visible again, where it
	// would be a hitch the user can see.
	//
	// The cost that is real and is not solved by this flag, only named: a
	// state write inside a hidden subtree still rebuilds and re-lays it out.
	// A background task writing into an inactive tab is the case; it costs a
	// build and a layout and no paint. A layouter that schedules work for
	// somebody else can ask [LayoutContext.OffScreen] and lower its priority
	// accordingly, which is what ui.ImageView does with the asset pipeline.
	//
	// What used to be a second real cost is not one any more. Every "keep
	// repainting" enrolment in this project — an [EventContext.Animate]
	// window, a kinetic fling, a scroll indicator linger — is *ended* when
	// the subtree is hidden rather than left to run to its deadline; see
	// [App.stopHiddenWork] for what each of them was measured to cost and why
	// none of them is resumed when the subtree comes back. An enrolment taken
	// out from a layouter, which is how ui.Toggle animates, is refused while
	// the node is hidden; see [App.animate].
	Hidden bool

	// Layer lets the backend keep the drawing of this subtree as a picture
	// of its own and composite that picture while the subtree does not
	// change – a cached layer, in the sense of Core Animation.
	//
	// # When it pays
	//
	// When a large subtree moves without changing, which is exactly what a
	// page transition is: without a layer every frame of the slide draws
	// every card, label and picture of both pages again; with one it draws
	// two textured rectangles. On a Raspberry Pi at full HD that is the
	// difference between a slide that stutters and one that does not.
	//
	// # Transitions do it by themselves
	//
	// A node that its [TransitionSpec] is moving is painted as a layer for
	// as long as it moves, whatever this field says, which is why the
	// navigation containers of package ui slide cheaply without asking.
	// Set Layer for a subtree that moves by other means – a Transform that
	// an animation changes – or that sits unchanged under something that
	// changes every frame.
	//
	// # How it knows
	//
	// It does not track anything. The subtree is painted every frame as
	// usual, in the layer's own coordinate space, and the backend compares
	// the operations with those of the frame before; see [render.OpLayer].
	// Equal operations are an equal picture. A change of any kind – a
	// picture that arrived, a caret, a new label – draws the layer again,
	// which costs one extra composite over not having a layer at all.
	//
	// # What it cannot do
	//
	// The picture is the element's bounds: a shadow or a badge that paints
	// outside them is cut off. A glass material shows what lies behind it,
	// and in a picture of its own nothing does; a layer with glass in it is
	// therefore drawn as if it were none, and saves nothing. A layer is drawn whole even where it is
	// clipped, so that it can move into view without being redrawn; a layer
	// much larger than the screen is therefore a waste of memory.
	Layer bool

	// FocusTrap confines the keyboard focus order to this node's subtree for
	// as long as the node is mounted.
	//
	// It is what makes a modal modal on the keyboard side. A scrim stops a
	// finger from reaching the button behind an alert; without this, tab
	// would still walk straight into it.
	//
	// The rule is one sentence: the *last* node in document order that
	// declares it wins, and [App.MoveFocus] then enumerates only that node's
	// subtree. Last in pre order means an alert stacked on top of a sheet
	// traps inside the alert, and a nested trap beats the one it is nested
	// in, because a child comes after its parent. In addition, the build that
	// applies a trap takes the focus away from anything outside it, so an
	// alert that opens over a focused text field leaves the focus nowhere
	// rather than on a field the user can no longer reach.
	//
	// What it is not: it does not stop a key event from *bubbling* out of the
	// trap to an ancestor interactor, because bubbling follows the tree and
	// not the focus order, and it does not block [EventContext.RequestFocus]
	// from a node outside — nothing outside can be reached by a pointer under
	// a scrim, so there is no caller.
	FocusTrap bool

	// Transition makes a change of Hidden a movement rather than a cut; see
	// [TransitionSpec].
	//
	// It is the one declaration in this struct that is read *after* the build
	// that made it, on every frame until the movement is over, and it is
	// therefore the one that has retained state behind it. The zero value is
	// the behaviour every node had before it existed.
	Transition TransitionSpec

	// KeyFallback declares that this node receives key events while *nothing*
	// holds the keyboard focus.
	//
	// Keys go to the focused node and bubble upwards, which is the right rule
	// and is no rule at all on the touchscreen kiosk of the project plan,
	// section 1: a panel with no keyboard attached never focuses anything, so
	// an application-wide key such as escape reaches nobody. The symptom was
	// a navigation stack that told the user to press escape and did nothing
	// when they did. A node that declares this flag is where such a key goes
	// instead; the event then bubbles from it exactly as it would have
	// bubbled from a focused node, so an outer handler still sees what the
	// inner one declined.
	//
	// The rule is [Element.FocusTrap]'s, deliberately: the *last* node in
	// document order that declares it wins, hidden subtrees are skipped, and
	// a node that is disabled or has no [Interactor] is not a candidate. A
	// nested navigation stack therefore beats the one it is nested in, and a
	// covered screen is not a candidate at all. See [App.keyFallbackNode].
	//
	// It changes nothing while something *is* focused. A keyboard user gets
	// the ordinary focused delivery and this flag never comes into play.
	KeyFallback bool

	// PreservesFocus declares that a press landing on this node, or anywhere
	// inside its subtree, leaves the keyboard focus where it is.
	//
	// A press moves the focus: onto the node it hit when that node is
	// focusable, and to nowhere when it is not — see [App.PointerDown] and
	// [App.setFocus] — which is what makes a tap on the background of a form
	// put an on-screen keyboard away. Exactly one kind of surface must be
	// exempt from that, and it is the surface that is typing *into* the
	// focused node: gift's own on-screen keyboard is not focusable, so
	// without this flag the first tap on a letter key would blur the field,
	// withdraw the keyboard and deliver the character to nobody.
	//
	// It is about focus and about nothing else. The node is an ordinary hit
	// target, gets the press, and takes the focus by asking for it if it
	// wants it.
	PreservesFocus bool
