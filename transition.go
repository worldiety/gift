// This file is the fourth "keep repainting for a while" mechanism, after the
// kinetic fling, the indicator linger and [EventContext.Animate], and it is
// the only one a *view* cannot express with the other three.
//
// The problem it solves is stated in one sentence: gift's navigation
// containers switch screens by flipping [Element.Hidden], the flag takes
// effect in the frame it is written, and a flag has no middle. A tab switch
// was therefore a hard cut of the whole window in a single frame — measured
// on the kitchen sink demo at 1,160,664 changed pixels between two
// consecutive frames, with the four frames after it bit-identical.
//
// Three ways of animating that were considered and rejected:
//
//   - the view interpolates and rebuilds every frame. It is what a naive
//     toolkit does and it is out of the question here: a rebuild per frame
//     allocates, and the project plan, section 11, puts the frame path under
//     a zero allocation contract that benchmarks assert.
//   - the view writes [Element.Transform] per frame. Same problem one level
//     down — Transform is a build time declaration behind a pointer, so a
//     value that changes every frame is a rebuild and an allocation per frame,
//     and the field documents exactly that as the reason scrolling does not
//     use it.
//   - a second animation system with callbacks and a scheduler. Rejected
//     because [ControlState] already establishes the shape this project uses
//     for "a number moving towards a target": retained presentation state on
//     the node, a pure function of that state and the clock, and no rebuild.
//
// So a transition is retained presentation state, exactly like a scroll
// offset and a control's phase: it is written when a *build* changes
// [Element.Hidden], it is read as a pure function of [App.BeginInput]'s clock
// by the paint side, and the repaint enrolment that keeps the frames coming
// is one entry in the same list [EventContext.Animate] uses.

// TransitionSpec declares where a node sits while it is hidden, so that
// [Element.Hidden] becomes a movement instead of a cut.
//
// The zero value is the whole of the previous behaviour: a node with no
// transition appears and disappears in one frame.
//
//	// a tab to the right of the selected one waits off the trailing edge
//	e.Transition = gift.TransitionSpec{
//		Parked:   geom.Pt(1, 0),
//		Duration: 180 * time.Millisecond,
//	}
//
// # The model: one number, and where the node is at each end of it
//
// A node carrying a spec has a *phase*: 0 while it is shown, 1 while it is
// hidden, and everything in between while it is moving from one to the other.
// The phase is a pure function of the retained state and the clock — the same
// design as [ControlState] and for the same reasons — so the painter reads it,
// nothing writes it per frame, and two nodes moving at once are exactly in
// step because they read one clock.
//
// Parked is where the node is at phase 1, as a fraction of *its own size*:
// {X: 1} is one full width towards the trailing edge, {X: -0.12} is an eighth
// of a width towards the leading edge, {Y: 1} is one full height down. A
// fraction and not a length, because the thing that moves is a screen and the
// distance that reads as "off the screen" is the size of the screen.
//
// Duration is how long the movement takes. Zero means no transition at all,
// whatever Parked says: a spec is opt-in on both fields.
//
// # What it costs while it runs, and what it costs afterwards
//
// While a transition runs, the node is painted *even though it is hidden*.
// That is the point — a screen that is sliding out has to be on the screen —
// and it is a real, bounded cost: for Duration, an outgoing tab costs a full
// paint of its subtree per frame. When the phase reaches 1 the node stops
// being painted and the guarantee [Element.Hidden] makes is back in force
// unchanged: a hidden tab costs one field read per frame and nothing else.
// Nothing here weakens that guarantee, it only postpones it by Duration.
//
// The repaint enrolment is bounded by Duration and is dropped by
// [App.tickAnimations] like every other one, so a transition always ends and
// the application always goes idle afterwards.
//
// It allocates once per node that has ever transitioned — the retained state
// is behind a pointer so that the nodes that never transition, which is
// almost all of them, carry eight bytes — and nothing per frame.
//
// # Input does not move with the picture, and that is deliberate
//
// [Element.Transform] is documented as shared between the two halves of a
// frame so that input and output cannot disagree about where a node is. This
// is the one transform that is not: the hit test ignores the phase entirely.
// A node that is hidden answers no tap from the first frame of its exit even
// though it is still drawn, and a node that is appearing answers taps at its
// *final* position from the first frame of its entrance even though it is
// still drawn short of it.
//
// The alternative was considered and is worse for the target of this project.
// A kiosk user who taps during a transition is aiming at the screen that is
// arriving, and hit testing the moving picture would mean the target under
// their finger is a different one three frames later — a lottery whose odds
// change during the gesture. The cost of this choice is a window of at most
// Duration in which a tap near the leading edge lands on a control that has
// not visibly arrived there yet. At 180 ms that is measurable and, on a
// touchscreen, preferable to delaying the input or to aiming at a moving
// target. A transition must never make the machine feel slower than the cut
// it replaced.
//
// # Interrupting it
//
// # Two ends and a memory
//
// Parked is where the node goes when it is hidden. Entry is where it comes
// *from* when it is mounted already visible into an application that is
// already on the screen, which is what a navigation push is; the zero Entry
// means "the same place as Parked", which is what every other caller wants.
//
// The two are not the same for a navigation stack and that is the whole
// reason Entry exists: a screen that is pushed arrives from the trailing edge
// and a screen that is *covered* waits a little way towards the leading one,
// so the place a screen came from and the place it will wait are on opposite
// sides of the window. The node remembers which place it is actually parked
// at, so a screen that is uncovered again comes back from the side it went
// to rather than from the side a freshly pushed screen would arrive from.
//
// # Interrupting it
//
// A build that flips [Element.Hidden] back while a transition is running
// turns the node round from wherever it is at that instant rather than
// jumping to the end first; that is [retargetTransition], and it is the rule
// [retarget] already applies to a control whose switch is flicked twice.
