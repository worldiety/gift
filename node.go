// nodeData is the gift owned payload of a scene node.
//
// It is stored *inline* in the node, not behind a pointer: a tree of N nodes
// costs N node structs inside the store's blocks and no separate heap object
// per node. The scene store never clears it on free, which is what makes an
// unmount/remount cycle allocation free — the child side tables keep their
// backing arrays and the recycled slot hands them straight back. See the
// documentation of the scene package.
//
// The flip side is that everything the garbage collector must not retain has
// to be released explicitly, which is what [App.destroyScopes] does.
type nodeData struct {
	// view is the view description the node was last built from. It is kept
	// for diagnostics and for the ownership check.
	view View
	// scope is non nil exactly for component nodes.
	scope *scope

	layouter Layouter
	painter  Painter

	// label is [Element.Label]: what a person would call this node. It is
	// written once per build and read by nothing in the frame path; see the
	// documentation of that field.
	label string

	// interactor, focusable, disabled and clip are the input half of the
	// element; see [Element]. They are plain fields in the payload, so the
	// hit test reads them without an interface dispatch and the dispatcher
	// writes hover and press without touching the view.
	interactor Interactor
	focusable  bool
	disabled   bool
	clip       bool

	// obstructs is [Element.Obstructs]. It is read by nothing in the frame
	// path; the node it names is remembered in [softInputState] instead, and
	// this field only says whether this node is that one.
	obstructs bool

	// hidden is [Element.Hidden]: the subtree is mounted but is not painted,
	// not hit tested and not in the focus order.
	hidden bool

	// layer is [Element.Layer].
	layer bool

	// focusTrap is [Element.FocusTrap]: while this node is mounted, the focus
	// order is confined to its subtree. See [App.focusRoot].
	focusTrap bool

	// keyFallback is [Element.KeyFallback]: this node receives key events
	// while nothing holds the focus. See [App.keyFallbackNode].
	keyFallback bool

	// preservesFocus is [Element.PreservesFocus]: a press inside this
	// subtree does not move the focus. See [App.PointerDown].
	preservesFocus bool

	// xform is [Element.Transform]. It is a pointer because the common case
	// is the identity and a nil check is cheaper than comparing six floats.
	xform *geom.Affine2D

	// trans is the retained half of [Element.Transition]: where this node is
	// between "shown" and "hidden", and how it got there. It is nil for
	// every node that never declared a transition, which is all of them
	// except the layers of ui's three navigation containers, and it is a
	// pointer for exactly that reason — see [nodeData.scroll], which is a
	// pointer for the same one.
	trans *transitionState

	// scroll is the retained presentation state of a scroll container, nil
	// for every other node. Like [Interaction] it lives here and not in the
	// view, because the project plan, section 5, requires the scroll offset
	// to survive a rebuild and, much more importantly, not to cause one.
	//
	// It translates the *children* of this node rather than the node itself,
	// which is what lets one node be both the clipping viewport and the
	// source of the content transform; see [App.beginSubtree].
	scroll *scrollState

	// control is the retained gesture and animation state of a control; see
	// [ControlState]. It is a value and not a pointer, because it is six
	// words and a pointer would be an allocation per control node for the
	// sake of saving them on every node that is not one.
	//
	// It is *not* refreshed from the element, exactly like ia below: a
	// rebuild replaces the view and not the node, and the whole reason this
	// field exists is that a control rebuilds itself on every step of its own
	// gesture. It is dropped when the node is unmounted, like every other
	// payload field that outlives a build; see [nodeData.release].
	control ControlState

	// ia is the interaction state gift owns for this node. It lives here and
	// not in the view because that is what makes hover and press survive a
	// rebuild and, more importantly, what makes them not cause one; see
	// [Interaction].
	ia Interaction

	// flex is [Element.Flex] of the last build. It is plain old data stored
	// inline, so that a stack can read the flexibility of a child without an
	// interface dispatch and without allocating.
	flex float32

	// children mirrors the scene sibling list as an indexable slice, because
	// layout and paint address children by index.
	children []scene.Handle
	// next is the scratch buffer for the child list under construction. It
	// is swapped with children at the end of a reconciliation, so neither
	// slice is ever reallocated in the steady state.
	next []scene.Handle
	// used marks which of the previous children have been claimed during the
	// current reconciliation.
	used []bool

	// childViews is the children slice handed over by the last build. gift

	// haveLastC says whether they mean anything yet.
	//
	// This is the cache that makes partial relayout possible: a node that is
	// not marked dirty and is asked for the same constraints again returns
	// its previous size without running its layouter and therefore without
	// touching its subtree. See [App.layoutNode].
