//
// The project plan, section 8, says the glass backdrop is a "Regionskopie" and
// limits the extra cost to one target holding the material region. That is not
// implementable against Ebitengine's screen image, and the reason is in the
// pinned source rather than in an opinion: internal/atlas's (*Image).allocate
// panics with "atlas: a screen image cannot be created as a source" the moment
// a screen image is used as a draw source. Kage has no framebuffer fetch
// either — that is section 8's own first reason — so there are exactly two
// ways to obtain the pixels underneath a material, and reading the screen is
// not one of them. The other is to draw the frame somewhere that *can* be a
// source.
//
// So gift renders the whole frame into one screen sized offscreen and blits it
// to the screen in [Renderer.EndFrame]. The costs, stated rather than buried:
//
//   - One screen sized target, 8 MiB of logical pixel bytes at 1080p. It is
//     one per window and not one per widget, which is the thing the project
//     plan, section 11, actually forbids, and it is leased from the same
//     bounded pool as everything else.
//   - One full screen blit per frame, plus one full screen clear. On a fill
//     rate bound GPU that is two extra passes over the framebuffer.
//   - Both are paid only while a material that needs a live backdrop is on
//     screen; live is the answer of [Renderer.planBackdrops]. A frame with
//     no such material never allocates the target and never blits; the pool
//     ages it out two seconds after the last live glass panel disappears.
//
// The region copy itself is still a region copy, and the blur chain is still
// confined to the region. What section 8 could not have known is that the
// *source* of that copy has to be manufactured first.
//
// # Why the decision is taken here and not in BeginFrame
//
// Because BeginFrame has no list. The plan is one pass over the operations,
// which is cheap next to translating them, and it happens before any of them
// is drawn.
//
// A material in a *second* list, submitted after something has already been
// drawn, is too late: the pixels are on the screen and the screen cannot be
// read. Such a material degrades to the fallback and is counted in
// [RendererStats.GlassLate]. gift submits one list per frame, so the counter
// is expected to stay at zero; it exists because "expected to" is not the same
// as "does".

// clip has cut it, because clipping a convex piece only shrinks it and never
// carries it across a centre line.

// only in which texture the batch samples, and the mapping from a destination
// rectangle to a source rectangle through a clip is the same arithmetic. See
// [Renderer.appendImage].
//
// # Glyphs no longer come through here, and that is the fix of WU-W
//
// This function used to serve glyphs too, and its documentation carried a
// warning: the destination rectangle was the atlas rectangle mapped through
// xf, so a scale other than one stretched a bitmap rasterised at the glyph's
// nominal size, and under a nearest filter that duplicates and drops rows of
// coverage instead of resampling them. The note said the correct answer was
// to rasterise at the effective size and fold the device scale into the atlas
// key. That is what the device density of the project plan, section 18, now
// does — see [GlyphAtlas.Lookup] — and the note has become the behaviour:
// [Renderer.appendGlyphs] transforms the glyph *origin* and hands the mask's
// own device extent to [Renderer.appendDeviceQuad].
//
// The warning is therefore gone rather than more urgent. What remains true is
// the assumption *this* function still makes, which is nothing: it maps a
// rectangle through a transform and interpolates texture coordinates into the
// clip, at any scale, and an image is resampled on purpose. A thumbnail comes
// off a ladder of a few sizes and is drawn at whatever the tile rectangle
// happens to be, so the image material uses a linear filter while the glyph
// material uses a nearest one. That is the only difference between the two

	// This is the interesting one. A node that reports a zero extent on an

	// SkippedNoImage counts image operations whose resource was not resident:
	// an id of zero, or one whose texture was evicted between the resolution
	// and the draw. A view that draws a placeholder when [render.Images]
	// refuses it never produces one; a non zero value means somebody emitted
	// an operation for a handle it had not resolved this frame.
	SkippedNoImage uint64
	// SkippedEmptyText counts glyph operations that produced no quad: an
	// empty range, a run of nothing but spaces, a run entirely outside its
