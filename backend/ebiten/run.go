	// TPS is the tick rate, that is the number of update callbacks per
	// second. Zero or less selects Ebitengine's default of sixty.
	//
	// It does not set the frame rate. Ebitengine draws as often as the
	// display and the driver allow, and several updates may happen between
	// two drawn frames; the project plan, section 6, is explicit about this.
	TPS int

	// IdleTPS, if greater than zero, lowers the tick rate to this value once
	// IdleFrames consecutive updates have changed nothing.
	//
	// # Why this exists
	//
	// Without change and without animation Ebitengine still ticks and draws
	// sixty times per second, because that is its model; gift has no on
	// demand rendering and the project plan, section 6, rules it out. On a
	// Raspberry Pi that constant load is heat, and heat is thermal
	// throttling, which then shows up as missed frame intervals in a
	// measurement that has nothing to do with the scene. Lowering the tick
	// rate while nothing happens is the sanctioned countermeasure — an
	// application policy, not a second presentation path.
	//
	// It is off by default because it changes what is being measured. A
	// benchmark must state whether it was on.
	IdleTPS int

	// IdleFrames is the number of unchanged updates before the idle tick
	// rate is applied. Zero or less selects sixty, that is about a second.
	IdleFrames int

	// DrawOnDemand skips drawing a frame when nothing on the screen has
	// changed, and leaves the previous frame standing instead.
	//
	// # Why this exists next to IdleTPS
	//
	// IdleTPS lowers the *update* rate. Ebitengine calls Draw once per
	// display refresh whatever the tick rate is, and gift used to paint the
	// whole display list in every one of them: sixty full frames a second of
	// shaders, glyph quads and blurred glass for a screen that shows a clock
	// changing once a minute. On a Raspberry Pi in a closed housing that is
	// the heat. Lowering the tick rate alone does not touch it.
	//
	// With this set, Ebitengine is told not to clear the screen between
	// frames — its documented way to skip drawing, see
	// ebiten.SetScreenClearedEveryFrame — and Draw paints only when
	//
	//   - the tree changed since the last paint ([gift.App.NeedsPaint]),
	//     which is also what every animation, caret blink, progress bar and
	//     control transition keeps true while it runs,
	//   - the renderer left work for another frame ([Renderer.NeedsFrame]:
	//     picture uploads the per frame budget deferred),
	//   - or the screen changed size, or the frame is one of the first two.
	//
	// Everything else is a refresh with nothing to say, and costs a single
	// copy of the retained frame inside Ebitengine. A screenshot through the
	// automation interface shows that retained frame too, so a driver sees
	// what the user sees and not a frame painted for its benefit.
	//
	// # What it relies on
	//
	// That nothing appears on the screen without a paint request. That is
	// the discipline gift already keeps — a painter that reads the clock
	// enrols with Animate, a picture that arrives invalidates its node — and
	// it is what [Config.IdleTPS] has been measuring idleness with. A
	// painter that changes its output silently shows the old frame until
	// something else repaints; that is a bug in the painter, and with this
	// flag it becomes visible instead of being papered over at sixty hertz.
	//
	// It is off by default because it changes what a frame interval
	// measurement means: a benchmark of a still scene would record only the
	// frames that were drawn. Kiosks and appliances want it on.
	DrawOnDemand bool

	// DirectToScreen draws the frame straight into Ebitengine's final
	// screen instead of its offscreen.
	//
	// # Why
	//
	// Ebitengine hands Draw an offscreen and copies it onto the real
	// framebuffer afterwards. That copy is a full screen pass of its own, and
	// on a Raspberry Pi at 1920x1080 a full screen pass is most of a frame:
	// measured on a Pi 400, a single fill through the offscreen took 22.1 ms,
	// the same fill into the final screen 14.8 ms. Rendering at a lower
	// resolution and letting the copy scale did not help (23.2 ms): the cost
	// is the copy, not the content.
	//
	// # How
	//
	// Draw paints the display list and only marks the offscreen as modified,
	// so that Ebitengine presents the frame; the list is then submitted in
	// DrawFinalScreen onto the framebuffer. Ebitengine keeps presenting for a
	// few frames after the last change, and clears the framebuffer before
	// each of them, so those frames submit the last list again; after that it
	// stops swapping and the screen keeps the frame.
	//
	// The old path is taken for a frame whose offscreen and framebuffer
	// differ in size (a letterboxed window), and for a frame the automation
	// interface captures, because the framebuffer cannot be read back.
	DirectToScreen bool

	// NominalFrameInterval is the interval the display is expected to hold,
	// for example 16667 microseconds at sixty hertz. Zero or less derives it
	// from TPS.
	//
	// # Why this is a field and not simply TPS
	//
	// TPS is the update rate. FrameInterval measures the distance between two
	// draw callbacks, and Ebitengine draws as often as the display and the
	// driver allow, which is a different number — the project plan,
	// section 6, is explicit that several updates may happen between two
	// frames. Deriving the frame threshold from the tick rate is therefore an
	// assumption, and it is only correct when the two happen to coincide,
	// which is the common sixty hertz case and nothing more. Set this field
	// when they do not, for example on a 50 Hz panel.
	NominalFrameInterval time.Duration

	// IntervalTolerance is the slack added to the nominal interval before a
	// frame counts as missed. Zero selects
	// [metrics.DefaultIntervalTolerance].
	//
	// It exists because the obvious thing is wrong. A strict comparison
	// against the bare nominal interval reported 50 % of the frames of a
	// cleanly timed measurement as missed; the project plan, section 13,
	// therefore binds the threshold at 17.17 ms for sixty hertz, that is
	// 16.667 plus 0.5. Run used to construct its default timer with the raw
	// nominal interval, so every consumer that did not bring its own timer
	// silently measured against the retracted threshold.
	IntervalTolerance time.Duration

	// WarmupFrames is the number of leading frame intervals to discard. Zero
	// selects [metrics.DefaultWarmupIntervals]; a negative value keeps all of
	// them.
	//
	// Opening a window costs a first interval of well over a hundred
	// milliseconds, and at the default history size a sixty second run can
	// never evict it again. It is warm-up, not a missed frame, and the
	// project plan, section 13, judges the scene and not the startup.
	WarmupFrames int

	// OnRenderer, if non nil, is called once with the renderer before the
	// window opens. It is how an application reaches [RendererStats].
	//
	// The renderer belongs to the UI executor, so the only place the
	// application may legally read those counters from is OnUpdate.
	OnRenderer func(*Renderer)

	// OnUpdate runs once per update, after input has been dispatched into
	// gift and before gift builds and lays out.
	//
	// # Why it survived WU-H
	//
	// It used to be the only way an application could get anything to happen,
	// and the example abused it as a substitute for input. It is kept, with a
	// narrower job: it is the tick hook. Animations, timers, a benchmark that
	// stops after sixty seconds and a headless driver all need a callback per
	// update that is not an input event, and none of them are served by the
	// event model. What it is no longer is the input path — that is
	// [inputBridge], and an application writes no code for it.
	//
	// Returning [Terminate] stops the loop and makes [Run] return nil, which

// # What Ebitengine means by these numbers
//
// Quoted from the pinned module, ebiten/v2@v2.10.1, run.go:
//
//	LayoutF accepts a native outside size in device-independent pixels and
//	returns the game's logical screen size in pixels. The logical size is
//	used for 1) the screen size given at Draw and 2) calculation of the
//	scale from the screen to the final screen size. For 1), the actual
//	screen size is the logical size rounded up.
//
// Two things follow, and they are the whole of the project plan, section 18,
// on this side. The outside size is in *device-independent* units, so it is
// gift's logical viewport and is handed to [gift.App.Update] unchanged. The
// returned size is what the screen image at Draw is, and the ratio between
// the two is the scale Ebitengine applies on the way to the framebuffer.
// Returning the outside size unchanged — which is what this did until WU-W —
// therefore asks Ebitengine to take a 1x picture and filter it up to a 2x
// panel, which is the blur this work unit is about. Returning the outside
// size times the density makes that scale exactly one, and every pixel gift
// writes is a pixel of the display.
//
// # The density
//
// It comes from ebiten.Monitor().DeviceScaleFactor() and is rounded to an
// integer by [gift.App.SetDensity], which is the single rounding point of the
// project plan, section 18. It is read here, on every call, rather than once
// at start-up, because Ebitengine documents that Layout "is called almost
// every frame" and because a window dragged from a Retina panel to an
// external one changes the factor without any other notification. The cost is
// one method call and a float compare per frame.
//
// # What a fractional factor produces
//
// A monitor reporting 1.5 is rounded to 2, so this returns twice the outside
// size while Ebitengine's final screen is 1.5 times it. Ebitengine then
// *downsamples* by three quarters instead of upsampling by one half. That is
// supersampling: sharper than the 1x frame it replaces, softer than a true
// 1.5 would be, and it costs the fragments of a 2x frame. The plan excludes
