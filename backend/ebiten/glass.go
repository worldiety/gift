// GlassPolicy chooses between [render.Reduced] and [render.Full].
//
// # Why it is measurement based and not capability based
//
// Because there is nothing to query. Ebitengine exposes no GL version, no
// extension list and no GPU memory figure; the project plan, section 6, states
// that outright and WU-D and WU-E both ran into it. There is no honest way to
// ask a machine whether it can afford a blur, so the only remaining question
// is whether it is in fact affording one, and that is a frame interval.
//
// # What it decides on
//
// Two signals, deliberately of different character:
//
//   - The median of a sliding window of intervals between drawn frames,
//     with separate down and up thresholds and a minimum dwell time per
//     level. This is the lagging signal: it can only react after the frames
//     have already been missed, and the hysteresis and dwell exist so that it
//     cannot oscillate while reacting.
//   - The material area of the frame as a fraction of the screen. This is
//     the leading signal: the project plan, section 13, states the Full budget
//     only for a material area up to a quarter of the screen, so a frame that
//     exceeds it is outside the envelope and is drawn Reduced immediately,
//     with no dwell at all. Coming back is a different question and is
//     answered with a band of its own — [GlassPolicyConfig.UpAreaFraction] and
//     [GlassPolicyConfig.AreaWindow] — so a panel that hovers around the limit
//     does not flicker. The asymmetry is deliberate: leaving the envelope has
//     to be acted on now, re-entering it has to be believed first.
//
// # Pinning
//
// [GlassPolicy.Pin] fixes a level and [GlassPolicy.Unpin] returns to the
// policy. A pinned level never changes, whatever the measurements say, and
// section 13 makes pinning mandatory for any measurement that is meant to be
// compared with another one.
