// # One texture per picture, and no atlas of our own
//
// A thumbnail gets its own [eb.Image]. There is deliberately no bespoke page
// packer here, unlike the glyph atlas next door, and the project plan,
// section 11, is the reason twice over.
//
// First, because Ebitengine already has one. An ordinary eb.Image is put on
// Ebitengine's automatic atlas whenever it fits: internal/atlas's
// canBePutOnAtlas returns true for any regular image no larger than maxSize,
// which is floorPowerOf2 of the driver's maximum texture edge and is therefore
// at least 4096 on anything that can run GL ES 3.0. A 512 pixel thumbnail —
// the largest rung of asset.DefaultSizes — is comfortably inside that, so the
// thumbnails of a gallery share backend textures without this package packing
// anything. "Zunaechst automatischer Ebitengine-Atlas und explizites
// Deallocate bei Eviction" is exactly what this is.
//
// Second, because the draw call argument for a bespoke atlas does not survive
// contact with what Ebitengine does with the commands. A batch here ends
// wherever the source image changes, so sixty visible tiles are sixty
// DrawTriangles calls; but graphicscommand's CanMergeWithDrawTrianglesCommand
// merges two consecutive draw commands whose *backend* source images are
// identical, and two thumbnails on one automatic atlas page are exactly that.
// The GPU therefore sees far fewer draws than this package issues, and a
// second atlas on top of the first would be paying for a measurement nobody
// has taken. The plan's sentence for that case is "Falls noetig, wird ein
// begrenzter Pool eigener Atlas-Seiten verglichen. Keine vorsorgliche eigene
// Atlas-Engine ohne Messung", and [RendererStats.ImageBatches] is the number
// that would justify taking it.
//
// The honest cost of one texture per picture is stated rather than hidden:
// every thumbnail pays Ebitengine's atlas padding, a 240 by 180 thumbnail
// wastes nothing but a 513 pixel one would get a texture of its own, and this
// package cannot see which of the two happened. [TextureStats.Bytes] is
// logical pixel bytes and not device memory; see [TextureConfig.MaxBytes].
//
// # Admission
//
// [TextureCache.Acquire] uploads at most [TextureConfig.UploadsPerFrame]
// textures and [TextureConfig.UploadBytesPerFrame] bytes per *drawn* frame.
// The budget is reset in [TextureCache.BeginFrame], which the renderer calls
// from [Renderer.BeginFrame], and painting is the only thing that happens once
// per drawn frame — so several Ebitengine updates before one draw cannot spend
// the budget several times. That is the distinction the project plan,
// section 11, draws and the one this whole type is arranged around.
//
// # Eviction
//
// Least recently drawn first, on two triggers, exactly like [GlyphAtlas]:
// pressure against [TextureConfig.MaxBytes] when a new texture needs room, and
// age in [TextureCache.Tick]. Evicting calls [eb.Image.Deallocate], which is
// the explicit release the project plan, section 11, asks for instead of
// waiting for a cleanup function.

// evicted. Its vertices may already be in the renderer's buffers, and
