// not depend on the tick rate. The total distance of an undamped fling is
// v0/k, so a flick at 2000 px/s with k = 4 travels 500 logical pixels and is
// visually over after about 700 ms.

	//
	// # What it changes
	//
	// An ordinary scroll container lays its children out once and then moves
	// them with a matrix; changing the offset marks the node for repaint and
	// nothing else, which is the whole claim of the scroll fast path. A
	// virtualising container — the gallery of the project plan, section 10 —
	// has no node for most of its content: it decides on every offset which
	// of its bounded set of tiles stands for which item, and that decision is
	// made in [Layouter.Layout] through [LayoutContext.ScrollOffset]. For
	// such a container an offset change must invalidate *layout*, or the
	// tiles would keep standing for the items they stood for at the offset
	// the last layout saw.
	//
	// So: with Virtual set, [App.setScroll] marks the node for layout rather
	// than only for paint. Nothing is rebuilt either way — no view function
	// runs, [Diagnostics.Builds] does not move — and the layout that follows
	// descends along the marked path only, so no sibling subtree is touched.
	//
	// # The honest price
	//
	// It is *not* the depth of the tree plus this one layouter, which is what
	// this paragraph claimed until WU-O. The container's own layouter runs,
	// and so does the layouter of every child whose constraints changed,
	// because [App.layoutNode] only answers from its cache when the incoming
	// constraints are identical to the last ones. A virtualising container
	// measures its children with tight constraints derived from the content,
	// so any child that changed size runs — and for the masonry gallery of
	// the project plan, section 10, a scroll changes the height of most tiles
	// in the band, because the tile at a given slot now stands for a
	// different picture.
	//
	// The bound is therefore: the depth of the marked path, plus one, plus
	// one per child of the container. All three terms are bounded by the
	// viewport and none of them by the item count, which is the property that
	// matters and the one TestGalleryScrollPathCost asserts. Measured there
	// at 800x600: twelve layouters for a pool of fourteen, identically at a
	// hundred and at a hundred thousand entries.
	//
	// # Why it is opt in
	//
	// Because relayouting on every wheel notch is exactly what an ordinary
	// scroller must not do, and a default that did it would quietly undo the
	// property ui.ScrollView documents and gifttest asserts. A container that
	// does not read [LayoutContext.ScrollOffset] has nothing to gain from it.

// timer while the user holds the thumb would therefore lose the grab in the
// middle of the gesture, and the next move would fall through to
// [ScrollInteractor] and be read as a content drag — which moves the content
// the opposite way from the thumb. The scroll offset is kept across a rebuild
// for exactly the same reason (see [App.applyScroll]), and the grab that
// drives the offset cannot be held to a weaker standard than the offset.
//
// So it lives here, beside the offset, in the state object a rebuild

// It is a stateless empty struct: everything it touches lives in the node
// payload, so there is exactly one instance for the whole process and
// declaring a scroll container costs no allocation on the input side.
//
// # Overscroll chaining
//
// A wheel event is delivered to the node under the pointer and bubbles
// upwards; see [App.PointerWheel]. The rule this handler implements is:
//
//   - A container consumes the event when the requested movement would change
//     its offset at all, and it then consumes the *whole* event even if it can
//     only move part of the way. Splitting a wheel notch between two nested
//     scrollers looks like a stuck scrollbar and is what browsers deliberately
//     avoid.
//   - A container that is already at the limit in the requested direction, or
//     whose axis the event has no component along, does not consume it. The
//     event bubbles to the next scrollable ancestor, which is the behaviour a
//     reader expects at the end of a nested list.
//   - The rule is per direction and evaluated per event. A container at the
//     bottom still consumes a scroll upwards.
//
// Drag follows the same rule at the moment the drag is claimed, and not
// afterwards: once a container owns the gesture it keeps it until the release,
// because handing a finger over to another scroller half way through a stroke
// is worse than stopping at the end.

// just made, which is the one window in which the application is least likely

// along y means nothing along x — and a grab taken along y means nothing
