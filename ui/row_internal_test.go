// TestTheLargestRowBuildsItsChildrenInOneAllocation is the claim
// [RowView.parts] makes about itself: "the slice is one allocation whatever
// the combination of options".
//
// It is an internal test because parts is unexported and because the property
// is about the slice and not about anything a caller can see. A row with six
// children laid out from a slice of capacity five is indistinguishable on the
// screen from one laid out from a slice of capacity six; the only difference
// is a regrow and a copy, once per row, on every rebuild.
//
// The fixture is the largest row this type can produce — every one of the six
// appends taken — and it is exactly the shape the documentation of [RowView]
// uses in its own example with an accessory added.
//
// # Why it reads the capacity and does not count allocations
//
// Because counting them cannot see the one allocation in question. Each of
// those six children is itself built by a chain of builder calls, and the
// widest row allocates nine times per call whatever the capacity is; the
// regrow is one of nine and a threshold around it would be a threshold around
// noise. The capacity is the direct observation and it is exact: a slice made
// with the right capacity and appended to exactly that many times comes back
// with cap == len, and one that had to grow comes back with the larger
// capacity Go's growth function chose. At a capacity of five this reports
// ten.
