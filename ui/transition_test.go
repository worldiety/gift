// Every test in this file is a *pair* of frames or better, and that is not a
// stylistic preference: the defect these transitions fix presented as "frame
// 4000 differs from frame 3999 by 1,723,004 pixels and frames 4006, 4012,
// 4018 and 4024 are bit identical to it", so a single frame proves nothing at
// all. What proves a transition is that two frames taken at two known points
// of it differ, and that two frames taken after it has ended do not.
//
// The clock is the harness's, which is the clock [gift.App.BeginInput] is
// given, so every one of these runs in microseconds and none of them can
// flake: a transition is a pure function of that clock; see
// [gift.TransitionSpec].
