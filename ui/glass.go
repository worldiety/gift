// # What it is and is not
//
// It is a backdrop dependent background. The backdrop is everything that was
// drawn before the node and nothing else — not the node's own content, not its
// children, not a later sibling — and it is clipped to the node's shape, that
// is to its bounds and [CornerRadius]. Scrolling underneath it makes it dirty,
// every frame, so a glass frame that never moves is still re-blurred whenever
// what is behind it moves.
//
// # Over a picture it is cheap
//
// When all that lies behind a pane is one opaque picture – a wallpaper, a
// photo – with nothing drawn over it inside the pane, the backend blurs that
// picture once, keeps it, and draws the pane as a single pass that samples
// it. No copy of the screen, no blur per frame, and none of the barrier that
// makes live glass expensive on a tile based GPU such as a Raspberry Pi's.
// Nothing has to be declared for it: put the panes on the picture and keep
// other content from underneath them. The backend's backdrop.go says what it
// overlooks.
//
// It is not a reimplementation of anybody else's material. The project plan,
// section 8, states plainly that there is no claim to pixel parity with
// Apple's Liquid Glass and that the [Full] level is experimental, and neither
// this function nor the shader behind it claims otherwise.
//
// # Cost
//
// [Reduced] is one region copy and one composite pass over the material
// region. [Full] adds a dual-Kawase down and up chain, also confined to the
// region. Neither is free and neither touches the whole screen; see the
// backend's glass documentation for the measured numbers and for the one place
// where the implementation had to depart from section 8.
