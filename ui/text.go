// TextView is a run of text. It is created by [Text]; the zero value is not
// useful.
//
// # Size
//
// A TextView measures itself by shaping its string against the width its
// constraints allow and reporting the extent of the result. That is the same
// shaping result the glyphs are drawn from — internal/text has exactly one
// entry point and it returns a size and the glyphs it was computed from
// together — so a label can never be measured differently from how it is
// drawn.
//
// Wrapping happens at word boundaries. A single word wider than the limit is
// *not* broken, hyphenated, scaled or truncated: it keeps its honest width,
// the node reports the width its constraints permit, and the difference is
// reported through [gift.LayoutContext.ReportOverflow] and shows up in
// [gift.Diagnostics] like every other overflow. That is the text form of the
// overflow model of the project plan, section 7.
//
// The one exception is asked for by name: a view with [TextView.MaxLines] or
// [TextView.Truncation] shortens its last visible line with an ellipsis
// instead, and reports what the ellipsis hides as overflow all the same; see
// [TextView.MaxLines].
//
// # Colour
//
// A TextView that was not given a [TextView.Foreground] draws in [ColorLabel],
// the semantic colour of primary text, resolved against the theme in force
// when the view is built. There used to be an exported DefaultForeground
// variable here, and it was the one accidental global lever this package had:
// process wide, mutable, and able to recolour exactly one thing. It is gone.
// The lever is [SetTheme], which moves the text and the controls together and
// does so for both appearances; see the project plan, section 20.
//
// # Font
//
// gift links no font unless the application asks for one. A TextView uses
// [TextView.Font] if it was given one and the application wide
// [SetDefaultFont] otherwise; with neither, building it panics with an
// explanation rather than rendering nothing. See [SetDefaultFont] and
// [RegisterFont].
//
// # The one cost of text that is not local to this view
//
// Shaping a string is cached, and the cache is one process wide budget of a
// mebibyte shared by every TextView, every [RowView] label, every button
// caption and every glyph the backend draws. It holds on the order of fifteen
// hundred short paragraphs.
//
// gift culls no paint, so every *visible* paragraph asks the shaper for its
// layout on every frame. Below the budget that is a hit and costs nothing. One
// paragraph past it and the least recently used entry being evicted is one
// that the same frame is about to ask for again, so the whole scene misses,
// every frame, whether or not anything changed — measured at 48,800
// allocations in a single idle frame of a scene with 1600 distinct labels, in
// a frame path the project plan, section 11, requires to allocate nothing.
//
// This is a property of the scene and not of any one widget, which is why it
// is documented here and in internal/text rather than on the first component
// that happened to be able to walk off it. Nothing reports it; the only
// symptom is that the device is slow. A screen with more than about a thousand
// distinct strings on it at once is the shape to be careful with, whatever
// arrangement of views produces it. See the package documentation of
// internal/text for the measurement and the remedies, and [ListView] for the
// form this takes in a long list.

// with nothing to say that the name goes on. The same happens to a last line
// that is a single word wider than the view. [TextView.Truncation] moves the
// ellipsis to the middle or the head, or turns it off.
//
// Only the last visible line is ever shortened. A word too wide for an earlier
// line of a wrapping label still overflows honestly, because an ellipsis in
// the middle of a paragraph would say the text continues somewhere it does
// not.
//
// # Why this is not a silent truncation
//
// The project plan, section 7, forbids content that does not fit from
// disappearing quietly, and MaxLines is the one modifier that deliberately
// drops content — so it pays the same price as everything else: the height of
// the lines that were cut is reported as vertical overflow and appears in

// one was asked for, at the call site, by name.
//
// It exists because the alternative for a fixed height row is worse. Without
// it a two line label in a list row either overflows into the row below it or
// forces every row to be tall enough for the longest entry, and both are
// decided by the data rather than by the design.
//
// The ellipsis is a visible mark, not a number, so it does not change any of
// this: the width it hides is reported as horizontal overflow and the lines
// it drops as vertical overflow, exactly as for the hard cut of
// [TruncateNone]. It is shaped by internal/text together with the rest of the
// line, which is why it can exist at all: a painter that drew "..." after a
// hard cut would put a glyph at a position no measurement ever saw.
//
// # What changed
//
// MaxLines used to cut hard and never draw an ellipsis. The tail ellipsis is
