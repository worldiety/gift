// A field edits a [TextEditor], which is where the text, the caret and the
// selection live and which is what makes them survive the rebuild that every
// keystroke causes; see [TextEditor]. The view is the declaration around it:
// the look, the placeholder, the callbacks and the disabled state.
//
// It handles what a single line field has to handle. Click to place the caret,
// drag to select, double click to select a word and triple click to select
// everything. The arrows, with shift to extend and with the word modifier to
// move by words, home and end, backspace and delete, all with gift's own key
// repeat. Select all, copy, cut and paste on [gift.ShortcutModifier].
// Horizontal scrolling when the text is wider than the field, with the caret
// always kept in view.
//
// Where [gift.WordModifier] and [gift.ShortcutModifier] are the same key —
// which is every platform except macOS — an arrow held with it is the word
// motion, and home and end are the way to the ends of the line. That is the
// precedence [gift.WordModifier] fixes and this is the view that spells it.
//
// # What it deliberately is not
//
// It is not a text editor and not a multi line one. There is no line break to
// enter: enter is a submission, a pasted line break ends the paste, and the
// project plan's exclusion list never promised more than one line here. There
// is no undo: an undo stack is a model of its own — it has to coalesce typing
// into edits a user recognises, and it has to survive the same rebuild the
// caret does — and a half built one is worse than none, so [gift.KeyZ] is not
// acted on at all.
//
// There is no auto scroll while a drag rests outside the field. Dragging past
// the left or the right edge selects up to wherever the last move reached and
// then stops; holding still there does not walk on through the text the way a
// list with a repeating timer would. That timer is a second animation with a
// rate, an acceleration and a stopping rule, and it is worth building when
// somebody has a value long enough to need it — a drag can already be
// continued by moving again, and shift-click and shift-arrow select any length
// without a drag at all.
//
// A drag is also not always the field's. A gesture that leaves the press more
// vertically than horizontally belongs to the scrolling form above the field,
// so that a column of fields on a touch kiosk can be scrolled by dragging one
// of them; see [textFieldNode.HandleEvent] for the whole rule and what it
// costs.
//
// It is not an IME. CJK composition, a preedit string and a candidate window
// stay excluded by the project plan, section 14. What is *not* excluded, and
// works: umlauts, accents, AltGr and dead keys. Those are the ordinary
// translation of key presses into characters that every keyboard outside the
// United States performs, they arrive fully resolved on [gift.EventRune], and
// the field inserts them like any other character. Typing "ö" on a German
// layout produces one rune here and one rune in the document.
//
// # The shortcut letters are physical keys
//
// Copy is [gift.ShortcutModifier] plus [gift.KeyC], and KeyC is the *position*
// of the C key on a US keyboard — that is Ebitengine's definition of a key
// code and gift inherits it. On a Dvorak or an AZERTY layout the five editing
// shortcuts therefore sit where that keyboard's US-QWERTY equivalents sit,
// which is what every toolkit does with these five and what a user who learned
// the finger position expects. It also means that on a layout where the C key
// produces something else entirely, the shortcut is still "the key in the C
// position". There is no way for gift to do better: the layout mapping lives
// in the platform and is only ever applied to characters, never to shortcuts.

// never the width of the content, because a field that grew as you typed would
// move every sibling with every character.
//
// Both of those make the size of a field independent of its text, on both
// axes, and that is worth naming because it is what an edit does *not* cost:
// no keystroke needs a new layout pass, in a column or in a row, so nothing
// here calls [gift.EventContext.RequestLayout]. An earlier version did, for

// the top padding, with the caret and the placeholder along with it, which on
// a 44 pixel field with a 16 pixel font read as a field whose text had
// slipped.
//
// The offset is rounded to a whole pixel, because the baseline is drawn from
// it and the project plan, section 7, rules out a fractional baseline. It is
// never negative: a field shorter than its line keeps the line at the top and
// clips the bottom, as before, rather than cutting into the ascenders.
//
// Only the vertical position moves. Hit testing maps a pointer to an offset

// --- input -------------------------------------------------------------------

// HandleEvent implements gift.Interactor.
//
// # The one trap, and what it costs
//
// A drag inside a scroll container normally has its press taken away: the
// container recognises the movement past [gift.DragSlop] and calls
// [gift.EventContext.StealPointer], which is exactly what should happen to a
// button and exactly what must not happen to a caret drag. The defence is the
// one [ScrollBar] uses for its thumb: this handler *consumes* every move while
// it is selecting, so the move never bubbles to the container, the container
// never recognises a drag, and the steal never happens.
//
// Consuming every move unconditionally, from the press onwards, would be the
// simple version and it has a price the simple version does not state: a form
// whose rows are mostly text fields could not be scrolled by dragging any of
// them. That is not a corner case on the kiosk of the project plan, section
// 19, where a finger arrives as a mouse under X11 and lands wherever the row
// happens to put a field. Measured on a column of one field and eleven boxes:
// a swipe over the field moved the form zero of a possible three hundred and
// thirteen pixels, a swipe over a box moved it eighty.
//
// So the gesture is decided by direction, once, at the slop:
//
//   - Between the press and [gift.DragSlop] nothing is consumed and nothing is
//     selected. Both this field and the container above it see every move, and
//     neither has claimed anything yet.
//   - On the first move past the slop, a gesture that has travelled further
//     down or up than sideways is *not* a selection. The field drops it, the
//     move bubbles, and the container scrolls as it would over any other row.
//   - Otherwise the field takes the capture and consumes every move until the
//     release.
//
// The cost of *this* version, stated: a caret drag that begins with a stroke
// more vertical than horizontal scrolls the form instead of selecting, and the
// first few pixels of every drag select nothing. Both are the standard
// behaviour of a text field in a scrolling list, and the alternative — decide
// on [gift.Event.Device] — is the one thing section 19 rules out by name,
// because on the target platform a touch *is* a mouse and the branch would
