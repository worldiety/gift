// # What it is for
//
// A small, fixed set of alternatives that are all worth showing at once —
// three or four, occasionally five. It is the Human Interface Guidelines'
// answer to "which of these views am I looking at", and it is the wrong
// control for a long list, for a list that changes at runtime, or for anything
// the user has to scroll to see: every segment is on screen, always, and they
// share the width equally, so a sixth segment makes all six too narrow to read
// rather than making the control scroll.
//
// # How it is operated
//
// Tap a segment, or focus the control and use the left and right arrows, which
// move the selection by one; home and end go to the ends. The whole control is
// one focus stop, not one per segment, because it stands for one value.
//
// Up and down work too and are the vertical spelling of the same step: up is
// the previous segment and down the next, as in any list. That is the
// *opposite* of a [SliderView], where up increases the value; see
// [segmentedNode.handleKey].
//
// The tap is decided where the finger *lifts*, so a finger that comes down on
// the wrong segment can slide onto the right one before lifting; see
// [segmentedNode.HandleEvent] for why that is not merely a nicety on a
// touchscreen.
//
// Arrow keys change the selection immediately rather than moving a cursor that
// a second key press confirms. That is what every platform's segmented control
// does and it is the right trade for a control whose segments switch a view:
// there is nothing destructive to confirm.
//
// # The labels
//
// They are ordinary [TextView] children, which is not an implementation
// detail: it means each segment carries its own string as a
// [gift.Element.Label], so a test finds a segment by its text and does not
// have to know where the control put it. The slice passed to
// [SegmentedControl] is *not* retained — the strings are turned into child
// views during the build and the slice is the caller's again on return.
//
// # The animation
//
// The indicator slides over [ControlAnimation] whenever the selection changes,
// whoever changed it, and then stops: a control at rest enrols in nothing and
// lets the machine sleep. See [gift.LayoutContext.SetControlState] for why
// that is driven from the layouter.

// HandleEvent implements gift.Interactor.

// # The segment is decided at the release, at the position of the release
//
// Not at the press, and not only for a gesture gift did not classify as a
// drag. A finger that comes down on the wrong segment can slide onto the right
// one and lift there, and that is the whole point: [gift.DragSlop] is eight
// logical pixels, which on the 1920x1080 panel this project targets is about
// 1.3 millimetres, so a finger that merely *rolls* while it lifts is already a
// drag by gift's reckoning. A control that declined a drag would therefore
// throw away ordinary taps, and the recovery gesture documented above would
// select nothing at all.
//
// A release outside the control still selects nothing: the finger left, and
// [gift.Event.Inside] is how it says so.
//
// # Why this does not fight an enclosing scroll view
//
// Because a scroll container does not wait for the release. It recognises the
// gesture on the *move*, calls [gift.EventContext.StealPointer], and the steal
// sends this node an EventPointerCancel and redirects every later event of
// that pointer — including the release — to the scroller. So a vertical swipe
// that begins on a segmented control inside a [ScrollView] scrolls and selects
// nothing, and it is the cancel and not a drag flag that says so.
//
// The case this does give up is a segmented control inside a *horizontally*
// scrolling view, where sliding along the control is the scroller's gesture
// and the control only gets a cancel. That is the same ambiguity every
// platform has and it is resolved the same way: the container wins.
//
// There is deliberately no flag recording that a press was seen, either. The
// release is delivered to whatever holds the pointer capture, and this node
// holds it exactly when the press landed on it; a node that lost the capture
// to a steal is sent a cancel and hears nothing more about that pointer. A
// flag would only distinguish a release bubbling up from an interactive
// descendant, and a segmented control has none — its children are the labels.
// That is the same exposure [ButtonView] has had since it was written, and
// inventing a branch for it here would be a branch no test can enter; see
// [disabledIsTheCoresBusiness] for why this package does not do that.
