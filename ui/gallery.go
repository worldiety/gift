// It is a plain value and not a view. Switching between the two at runtime is
// therefore an ordinary state change in the application — a different
// GalleryLayout comes out of the next build — and the gallery notices that its
// parameters changed, starts an incremental reflow and discards whatever
// reflow was already in flight. The project plan, section 10, asks for exactly
// that: "Ergebnisse veralteter Layouts werden verworfen."

// --- tile appearance ---------------------------------------------------------

// TileStyle is the look of one gallery tile.
//
// A tile draws its thumbnail when one is resident and a placeholder until
// then, so most of this style describes the *placeholder*: the palette, the
// provisional wash and the error fill are what is on screen while the picture
// is being fetched, decoded and uploaded, or instead of it when that failed.
// The rest — the selection border and the cursor ring — are properties of the
// tile and are drawn over the picture as well.
//
// Showing a placeholder rather than waiting is the behaviour the project plan,
// section 10, requires: "Schnelle Spruenge zeigen Platzhalter, statt auf Laden
// oder Decode zu warten." Nothing in the frame path blocks on a picture, and a
// jump of ten thousand entries paints its first frame with placeholders.
type TileStyle struct {
	// CornerRadius rounds the tile: the placeholder, the picture and the
	// selection and cursor borders, all with the same radius on the same
	// rectangle.
	//
	// It is one shape and not three that happen to agree, and the difference
	// is visible. The placeholder, the picture and a border of the same bounds
	// and radius cover exactly the same pixels — see [render.OpImage] — so a
	// tile does not change shape when its picture arrives, nothing of the
	// picture shows outside a selection border's rounded corner, and the
	// border's inner edge is the concentric arc of radius
	// max(0, CornerRadius-Width) rather than a square.
	CornerRadius float32

	// Palette is the set of placeholder fills. The entry is chosen by a hash
	// of the stable [asset.ID], never by the slot, so a tile that is recycled
	// changes colour with the item and a tile that scrolls out and back comes
	// back the same colour. That is the visible half of the recycling
	// contract of the project plan, section 13: "keine falschen Bilder nach
	// Tile-Recycling".
	//
	// An empty palette uses one neutral grey.
	//
	// Unlike the other colours here, a palette entry is not passed through
	// [ResolveColor]: the slice belongs to the caller — see the ownership
	// rule of the project plan, section 4 — and resolving it would mean
	// either writing into it or copying it every build. Palette entries are
	// stand-ins for photographs rather than interface chrome, so a semantic
	// colour has little to say about them; one written here is a defect that
	// the giftdebug build reports from render.
	Palette []Color

	// Provisional fills a tile whose real dimensions have not arrived yet, so
	// that the difference between a laid out guess and a laid out fact is
	// visible rather than claimed. A transparent value uses the palette.
	Provisional Color

	// Error fills a tile whose picture could not be loaded. A transparent
	// value falls back to the palette, which makes a failure invisible; the
	// project plan, section 15, wants a failed source to produce "einen
	// sichtbaren Fehlerzustand der betroffenen Kachel".
	Error Color

	// Selected is stroked inside a selected tile.
	Selected Border

	// Cursor is stroked inside the tile the keyboard cursor is on. It is
	// separate from Selected because the two are independent: control-arrow
	// moves the cursor without selecting, shift-arrow selects a range the
	// cursor is only one end of.
	Cursor Border

// --- the retained model ------------------------------------------------------

// DefaultGalleryRebuildBudget is how many item placements one incremental
// reflow step performs per layout pass.
//
// A full masonry reflow of n items costs about 2n of these, so the default
// spreads a 100 000 entry reflow over about seven passes. The project plan,
// section 10, permits a reflow to be O(N) but not to happen in one frame:
// "sie werden ausserhalb des Frame-Hotpaths oder inkrementell berechnet".
//
// The *first* build of a layout is not chunked, because there is nothing to
// show until it finishes and seven blank frames are worse than one slow one.
// Every reflow after it is, because the previous layout stays on screen and
// answers queries while the new one is built.
var DefaultGalleryRebuildBudget = 32768

// Gallery is the retained model of a virtualised image gallery: the catalogue,
// the selection, the spatial index and the pool of recycled tiles.
//
// # Why the application owns it and not the view
//
// The project plan, section 10, sketches the gallery as ui.ImageGallery(photos)
// — a view built from a collection. The sketch is an API sketch and this is
// where it had to give: a view value is rebuilt and thrown away on every build,
// and the thing that must survive is a 2.4 MB spatial index over 100 000
// entries and a pool of tiles whose bindings are the whole point. Reconstructing
// either per build would make a rebuild O(N) and would throw away the recycling
// evidence with it.
//
// So the split is explicit. The Gallery is a long lived object the application
// creates once and holds, exactly like the [asset.Collection] it wraps;
// [ImageGallery] is the short lived declaration that says how it should look
// right now. That also puts the durable selection where the project plan,
// section 5, requires it — "beim Collection-Owner, nicht im recycelten Tile" —
// without any machinery to put it there.
//

// --- the view ----------------------------------------------------------------

// GalleryView is the declaration half of a gallery: how the retained [Gallery]
// should look and behave right now. Create one with [ImageGallery].
//
// # It needs a bounded height
//
// Like [ScrollView], and for the same reason: a stack measures an inflexible
// child with an unbounded main axis — rule 1 of the overflow model of the
// project plan, section 7 — and a viewport as tall as its content shows
// everything and scrolls nothing. Give it a [GalleryView.Flex], a
// [GalleryView.Frame] or a [GalleryView.MaxHeight]. A gallery with an
// unbounded height reports a zero viewport, binds no tiles and is blank, which
// is the loud version of the failure.
//
// # The indicator
//
// A gallery draws the same scroll bar a [ScrollView] does, along its trailing
// edge; see [ScrollBar] and [GalleryView.ScrollBar]. A grab on the thumb takes
// the press away from the tile underneath it, so dragging the bar across the
// picture band scrolls and selects nothing.
//
// # What it costs to scroll
//
// More than an ordinary scroller and much less than a rebuild. A virtualising
// container declares [gift.ScrollSpec.Virtual], so an offset change invalidates
// the layout of this one node rather than only its paint: one binary search per
// masonry column, a rebinding of the tiles that changed item, and one
// [gift.LayoutContext.Measure] per tile.
//
// Most of those measurements really do run a layouter. gift answers a Measure
// from its cache only when the constraints are identical to the last ones, and
// the gallery measures every tile with constraints tight around its document
// rectangle — so a masonry scroll, which changes the y of every tile and the
// height of most of them, re-measures most of the band. The honest bound is
// therefore about one layouter per tile in the pool, plus the depth of the
// marked path. What it is *not* is a function of the catalogue: measured at
// 800x600 it is twelve layouters for a pool of fourteen, the same number at a
// hundred entries and at a hundred thousand. No view function runs and
// [gift.Diagnostics.Builds] does not move. The numbers are in

// bottom, then column 1 — so a prefix keeps whole leading columns and drops
// whole trailing ones, and the frame reads as the gallery collapsing to the
// left edge of the window. Measured on a 400 to 2400 pixel enlargement of a
// 100 000 entry masonry gallery: the frame in which the pool was still the old
// size bound six of thirty nine items and every one of them sat in the leftmost
// 430 pixels of a 2400 pixel viewport. Justified comes out in item order, so
// the same prefix there keeps the top rows and drops the bottom ones, which is
// the same defect turned ninety degrees.
//
// A stride keeps the band covering the whole viewport, in both modes, for the
// price of a gap between the kept tiles. That is the "Platzhalter statt
// Warten" behaviour of the project plan, section 10 — an under filled band —
// rather than a viewport that looks broken.
//
// It is O(k), in place and allocation free. It is also *stable*: the same
// visible set thinned to the same k yields the same tiles, so a pool that
