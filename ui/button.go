// ButtonStyle is the appearance of a button's own box in one interaction
// state. It is the [Border] and [Color] set a [BoxView] would take, named as
// one value so that a state can be described in one place.
//
// # A state style replaces, but the theme still shows through
//
// A state style, when set, replaces the whole box style for that state: it is
// not merged field by field with the normal style. That part is unchanged and
// the reason section 8 of the project plan gives for it still holds — merging
// two *caller supplied* styles would need a "was this field set" bit per
// field, and an exported struct a caller fills with a composite literal has no
// bit a literal could set.
//
// What did change, in the work unit that implemented section 20, is what an
// unset colour means. The zero [Color] in this struct is not "transparent", it
// is **"the theme decides"**:
//
//	ui.Button(label, act).PressedStyle(ui.ButtonStyle{CornerRadius: 10})
//
// gets the themed pressed face and no border, rather than an invisible
// button. A caller who genuinely wants nothing drawn writes [ColorClear],
// which is transparency by name. The same rule already applied to the numbers
// of [ScrollBar], where a zero Width means "the default" and not "no bar".
//
// [ButtonStyle.Border] follows it one level down: a Border with a width and an
// unset colour is stroked in [ColorSeparator], while a Border with no width is
// no border at all. Geometry is the call site's, the hue is the theme's. Note
// that this rule is local to ButtonStyle — [ButtonView.Border] and every other
// .Border modifier leave a colourless border invisible, because there the
// value is the caller's and not a field with a default under it.
//
// # The struct is read in two places, and they differ in one way
//
// [ButtonView.HoverStyle], [ButtonView.PressedStyle] and
// [ButtonView.DisabledStyle] take a *replacement*: every field of the value
// counts, an unset Border means no border, and an unset CornerRadius means a
// square corner. That is the whole-style replacement of section 8 and the
// reason the paragraph above exists.
//
// [ButtonView.Style] does not replace anything — it feeds the ordinary field
// by field style of the view, the same one [ButtonView.Background] and friends
// feed, which has a "was this set" bit per field. There an unset field means
// "the caller did not write it", so Style{CornerRadius: 11} keeps the themed
// face, the themed hairline *and* the themed hover and pressed faces, exactly
// like .CornerRadius(11) does. The two spellings used to disagree; see
// [ButtonView.Style].
type ButtonStyle struct {
	// Background fills the button's bounds. The zero value means the themed
	// face of the state this style belongs to; use [ColorClear] for none.

	// about colours.

// They are unexported, and they stay unexported now that a theme exists. An
// exported defaultButtonStyle would be a second process wide lever next to
// [SetTheme] — one that covers one widget, does not know about light and dark,
// and would silently win over the theme for anybody who assigned to it. The
// way to restyle every button in an application is a theme:
//
//	ui.SetTheme(app, ui.LightTheme().With(ui.ColorControl, ui.RGB(226, 232, 240)))

//
// # One separator for hover and pressed, a weaker one for disabled
//
// The old literals had a per state alpha ladder — 40, 60, 80 and 20 — and
// three quarters of it is deliberately gone. A hairline stepping by twenty
// units of alpha is below the threshold at which anybody reads it as feedback,
// while the face, which steps by twelve to thirty two units of colour, is what
// actually says "hovered". One separator is also the only version of that
// which can be themed without three more tokens.
//
// Disabled is the exception, and collapsing it into the same separator was a
// mistake worth naming: it took the hairline from alpha 20 to alpha 40, which
// made a disabled button's outline *twice as strong* as before and exactly as
// strong as an enabled one. The argument above does not cover this case,
// because it is about feedback and disabled is not feedback — it is an
// affordance, and the affordance is that there is less of the control. The
// face alone cannot carry it: [ColorControlDisabled] is a twenty-alpha wash in
// both themes, so a crisp full strength outline around a nearly absent face
// reads as an enabled button someone forgot to fill in.
//
// So the disabled hairline is [ColorSeparator] at half, which is the alpha 20
// it had before this work unit, expressed as a derivation of the one token
// instead of as a fourth one. That is what [Fade] is for and it costs no new
// role; see [disabledHairlineFade].

// theirs at full strength: it is a value they passed in, and the unset rule of
// [ButtonStyle] does not reach into a value somebody named.
const disabledHairlineFade = 0.5

// ButtonView is a pressable control around an arbitrary label view. It is
// created by [Button]; the zero value is not useful.
//
// # What it is
//
// The project plan, section 7, says a button is "Pointer-Capture,
// Pressed/Hover/Disabled, Tastaturfokus und Aktivierung per Space/Enter, nicht
// nur einen Maus-Klickhandler", and that is the list this type implements. A
// press captures the pointer, so releasing somewhere else does not activate;
// a touch taps without ever producing a hover; tab reaches the button and
// space or enter fires it; a disabled button is skipped by the focus order and
// ignores every one of those paths.
//
// # Styling
//
// Hover, pressed and disabled are presentation state that lives in the
// retained node, not in the view — see [gift.Interaction] — so a hover does
// not rebuild anything. The consequence for the API is that the four looks
// have to be declared up front rather than chosen by the application per
// frame: [ButtonView.HoverStyle], [ButtonView.PressedStyle] and
// [ButtonView.DisabledStyle] carry them, and the ordinary [ButtonView.Background],
// [ButtonView.Border] and [ButtonView.CornerRadius] modifiers describe the
// normal state like on any other view.
//
// # The label is the caller's
//
// A ButtonStyle covers the button's box and not its label. The label is an
// arbitrary [gift.View] and modifiers do not survive the View boundary — the
// project plan, section 4, "Styling endet an der View-Grenze" — so a button
// cannot recolour the text a caller handed it. A design that needs the label
// to change colour when pressed needs the pressed state at the call site, and
// that is a rebuild. This is a real limitation of variant A and is stated
// rather than papered over.
