// layoutScroll is the stack algorithm with the scroll axis unbounded.
//
// # Why the axis is measured unbounded
//
// A scroll container exists precisely so that its content may be larger than
// it is. Measuring the content against the viewport extent would make a tall
// column report the viewport height and there would be nothing to scroll; so
// the scroll axis is [geom.Unbounded] and the cross axis keeps the viewport's
// bound. That is also rule 1 of the overflow model of the project plan,
// section 7, applied to the one container where it is not merely a safety
// property but the whole point.
//
// # Why this is not an overflow
//
// Content taller than the viewport is the normal, intended state here, and
// [gift.Diagnostics.OverflowNodes] must stay zero for it — otherwise the one
// number that says "some container in this scene is lying about its size"
// would be noisy in exactly the scenes it is needed for, and
// [gifttest.Harness.AssertNoOverflow] would be useless in a gallery.
//
// The distinction is not "how much bigger" but *whether the content is
// reachable*. Rule 3 of the overflow model is about content that keeps honest
// positions nobody can ever see; here the content keeps honest positions and
// the user reaches all of them by scrolling. Mechanically it falls out of the
// measurement: the scroll axis is unbounded, and an unbounded axis cannot
// overflow because nothing was exceeded. The excess is reported through
// [gift.LayoutContext.ReportScrollContent] instead, where it is a content
// extent rather than a complaint.
//
// The *cross* axis is a different matter and is reported as an ordinary
// overflow. A child wider than a vertical scroller really is cut off and
// really is unreachable, because there is no horizontal offset to move it
// into view. That is the honest line between the two.

// layoutLayer is the layout of one screen of a navigation container: fill the
// area, and stretch the single child to fill it too.
//
// # Why this is not the overlay algorithm
//
// A [layer] is not a box that happens to hold one child, it *is* the screen —
// the whole of the tab, or the whole of the area above a navigation bar — and
// a screen that shrink-wrapped its content would be the wrong answer twice
// over. Its own size would be the width of the widest label on it, so a
// background behind it would not reach the edges of the window; and its
// child's would be the same, so a [VScroll] inside a tab would be as wide as
// its longest row rather than as wide as the tab.
//
// A stack measures its children with a *loose* cross axis — see
// layout.Stack — so neither of those falls out of the ordinary machinery, and
// there is no "stretch" cross alignment in this project to ask for. There does
// not need to be one here: a layer has exactly one child, and the question
// "where does the child sit inside the leftover space" has no leftover space
// to be about.
//
// # An unbounded axis is refused
//
// A layer must fill what it is given, and an axis with no finite maximum gives
// it nothing to fill. The earlier version of this function shrink-wrapped such
// an axis, and that was a silent defect of the worst class this project has:
// the scrim of a [ModalView] is a layer child with no content of its own, so
// on an unbounded axis it measured zero — while the alert above it sized and
// painted exactly as usual. The dialog was on the screen, looked right, and a
// tap went straight through it to the "Delete all" button underneath. Nothing
// reported it: the size equals the constraint on an unbounded axis, so the
// overflow is zero, there is no visual difference, and there is no diagnostic.
//
// A panic is therefore the only honest answer. "Documented and not fixed" was
// not available, because [ModalView] promises without qualification that the
// scrim swallows every pointer event; and a diagnostic that only fires under
// giftdebug would let a kiosk ship with a confirmation dialog that is
// decoration. The message names the composition, because the composition is
// always the same shape — a navigation container inside something that
// measures its children loosely, which in this package means a scroll
// container or an inflexible child of a stack.
