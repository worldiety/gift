// SetImagePipeline installs the application wide image pipeline that
// [Image] and every [Gallery] draw through.
//
// The project plan, section 10, requires that "ImageGallery ... verwendet
// denselben Bildservice wie ui.Image(source)", and this is the seam that makes
// it one service and not two: one [asset.Pipeline], so one fetch, one decode
// and one disk cache entry per picture, and one table of GPU textures, so one
// upload — even when the same source is on screen twice in two different
// widgets.
//
// It is process wide and mutable, exactly like [SetDefaultFont], and carries
// the same caveat the project plan, section 13, already records about process
// wide state: nothing here is safe against a test that calls t.Parallel, and
// the repository contains no such test. The alternative — threading a service
// through every view constructor — would put a second argument on
// ui.Image(source), which is the spelling the plan fixes in section 10.
//
// Passing nil detaches the pipeline. Views then draw their placeholders, which
// is what a layout test without a pipeline sees and is a normal, quiet state
// rather than an error.
//
// The application owns the pipeline's lifetime and closes it:
