// The on-screen keyboard tests of the project plan, section 19.
//
// Every one of them drives the widget through gifttest with real pointer
// events, because everything worth catching here is in the wiring: whether a
// drawn key reaches the field, whether it takes the focus away from it on the
// way, and whether the field it is typing into is still on the screen. None of
// them asserts on an internal signal — the subject is what ends up in the
// document.

// kbFixture is a scrolling form whose last row is a text field, with the
// keyboard in a ZStack with it. The form is deliberately taller than the
// window, so that revealing the field is a real scroll and not a no-op.
//
// By default the form makes room for the keyboard, which is what every ZStack
// holding one does; see [ui.Overlay.AvoidKeyboard]. [newKeyboardOverlapping]
// is the same fixture with that turned off, for the tests of the obstruction
// reveal, which is the only thing keeping the field clear in that
// composition.
