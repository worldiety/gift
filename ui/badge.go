// # It is a fixed height and a shrink-wrapped width
//
// The height is [BadgeHeight] at every density and for every string, so a
// column of badges lines up and the corner radius is exactly half the height —
// which is what makes it a capsule rather than a rounded rectangle that
// happens to look like one. The width is whatever the text needs plus an inset
// at each end, with a floor at the height so that a single digit is a circle
// rather than a slot.
//
// The text is one line and is not truncated. A badge with a sentence in it is
// a badge with the wrong content; a [TextView] with MaxLines is the thing that
// truncates, and silently shortening a count would be worse than a wide badge.
// That is why its label asks for [TruncateNone] explicitly: MaxLines alone
// ends in an ellipsis, and "12" squeezed into "1…" is a different number.

// # Colour
//
// [ColorAccent] behind [ColorOnAccent], which is the one pairing in the
// palette that is guaranteed legible in both themes — see [ColorOnAccent] —
// and therefore the only defensible default for a filled shape with text on
// it. [BadgeView.Color] and [BadgeView.Foreground] change them; a design that
// changes only one of the two is asking for the contrast failure that role
// exists to prevent.
