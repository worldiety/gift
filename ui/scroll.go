// ScrollView is a viewport that clips its children and lets the user move them
// along one axis. It is created by [VScroll] or [HScroll]; the zero value is
// not useful.
//
// # What it is
//
// A scroll view is a stack — the same [VStack] and [HStack] algorithm, with
// the same Gap, Padding and Align — inside a window that is smaller than it.
// The children are measured with the scroll axis unbounded, so a tall column
// stays tall, and the container reports the size its own constraints permit.
// The difference between the two is what there is to scroll.
//
// # What scrolling costs
//
// Nothing but a transform. The offset is presentation state in the retained
// node, exactly like hover and press — the project plan, section 5, requires
// that — so moving it rebuilds nothing and measures nothing: gift translates
// the children on the way into the subtree, for paint and for hit testing
// alike, from one declaration. [gift.Diagnostics.Scrolls] moves while
// [gift.Diagnostics.Builds] and [gift.Diagnostics.Layouts] stand still, and
// that is asserted rather than asserted about.
//
// # It needs a bounded extent
//
// A scroll view has to be told how big its window is, and a stack measures an
// inflexible child with an *unbounded* main axis — rule 1 of the overflow
// model of the project plan, section 7. So a bare VScroll inside a VStack has
// no viewport at all: it is as tall as its content and scrolling does nothing.
// Give it a [ScrollView.Flex] so it takes the leftover space, or a
// [ScrollView.Frame] or [ScrollView.MaxHeight]. The symptom is that scrolling
// does nothing at all; [gift.ScrollInfo] then reports a MaxOffset of zero and
// a ViewportExtent equal to the ContentExtent, which is the pair to look at.
//
// There is deliberately no giftdebug diagnosis for it. "The viewport is as
// large as the content" is also exactly what a scroller with three rows in it
// looks like, and a warning that fires on every correct short list is a
// warning people learn to ignore.
//
// # Input
//
// gift supplies the gesture handling: the wheel over any descendant, a drag
// past [gift.DragSlop] — which takes the press away from a button underneath —
// and a kinetic fling on release. The container is a hit target over its whole
// bounds, so a click on its empty background does not fall through to whatever
// is behind it, which is what every platform scroller does.
//
// # The indicator
//
// A scroll view draws a scroll bar along its trailing edge whenever there is
// more content than viewport. It appears while the content moves, holds for a
// moment and then fades; the thumb can be grabbed and dragged, and a click on
// the track pages one viewport towards the click. See [ScrollBar] for the
// style and for why it is a decoration of the container rather than a child.
