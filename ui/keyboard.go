// The on-screen keyboard of the project plan, section 19.
//
// # Why gift draws one at all
//
// Ebitengine offers no IME and no way to ask the platform for a soft keyboard,
// and the kiosk of section 1 — a Raspberry Pi behind a touchscreen, X11, no
// desktop — has no operating system keyboard that could be asked. A touch
// application on that machine has no way to enter text unless the framework
// draws the keys itself. So it does.
//
// # Why it is not raised by the pointer kind
//
// This is the one constraint section 19 states in bold and it is worth
// repeating where the code is. Ebitengine's documentation for AppendTouchIDs
// says the function does nothing on desktops; backend/ebiten/input.go records
// the same thing. On Raspberry Pi OS under X11 a touchscreen enumerates as a
// mouse, so every event gift sees from a finger arrives as [gift.PointerMouse]
// with [gift.PointerTouch] never occurring. A keyboard gated on the pointer
// kind would therefore be dead on exactly the hardware it exists for, and
// would pop up on the developer's laptop where it is not wanted — both
// failures at once, from the same line. The gate is [SetOnScreenKeyboard], an
// explicit statement about the machine.

// onScreenKeyboard is the kiosk switch. It is one bit for the whole process.
//
// # Why process wide, and why with the App
//
// "Is this program running on a touch kiosk with no hardware keyboard" is a
// property of the deployment, not of a field, not of a window and not of a
// call site. It is decided once, in main, by whoever built the image — the
// same place and the same kind of decision as [SetDefaultFont] and
// [SetClipboard], and for the same reason the plan gives for the theme: a
// per-field switch would have to be repeated on every field of every form,
// and the failure mode of forgetting it once is a field that cannot be typed
// into at all.
//
// It takes the [gift.App] for the reason [SetTheme] takes it: the views decide
// in Build whether there is a keyboard, so nothing changes on the screen until
// something rebuilds, and a caller who had to remember [gift.App.Invalidate]
// separately would have a switch that works only after the next unrelated
// interaction. A nil App is the ordinary case in main, before an App exists.
//
// It is an atomic rather than a plain bool because [SetTheme] set that
// precedent for a value that may legitimately be flipped while the program
// runs — a kiosk whose hardware keyboard was unplugged — and because the read
// is once per build of one view rather than anywhere in the frame path. It is
// deliberately less than the theme offers in one way: flipping it does not
// interpolate anything and does not preserve what somebody was typing.
var onScreenKeyboard atomic.Bool

// SetOnScreenKeyboard turns gift's own on-screen keyboard on or off for the
// whole process and asks app to rebuild, which is what makes the change
// visible. The default is off.
//
// Off is the default because a keyboard that appears on a developer's desktop
// whenever a field takes the focus is worse than no keyboard at all, and
// because gift cannot detect the kiosk: see [onScreenKeyboard] for why the
// pointer kind is not the evidence it looks like.
//
// With the switch on, a [TextFieldView] asks for the keyboard when it gains
// the focus and dismisses it when it loses it. The keyboard itself is a view
// the application places, once, at the top of its window:
//
//	ui.Window(
//	    form,
//	    ui.OnScreenKeyboard(),
//	).Align(geom.Bottom)
//
// The form is then laid out above the keyboard while it is showing; see
// [Overlay.AvoidKeyboard].
//
// An application that never places [OnScreenKeyboard] pays nothing for having
// the switch on beyond one bool per focus change.
//
// app may be nil, which sets the switch and repaints nothing; that is the call
// in main, next to [SetDefaultFont]. Calling it with a non nil app from a
// goroutine other than the UI one is a defect for the reason [SetTheme] gives:
// [gift.App.Invalidate] is not concurrency safe. Post it instead.

// [TextEditor], which would make every application declare and thread a
// keyboard handle for something it never reads.
//
// The cost is stated rather than hidden: two [gift.App] instances in one
// process share this, so shift pressed in one would show in the other. The
// same is already true of [SetTheme], [SetDefaultFont] and [SetClipboard], and

// KeyboardView is gift's own on-screen keyboard. It is created by
// [OnScreenKeyboard]; the zero value is not useful.
//
// # What it is
//
// A German layout with umlauts and ß, a digit row, a symbol page, shift, space,
// backspace and enter. It is one node: forty seven keys are forty seven
// rectangles this view draws and hit tests itself, not forty seven child
// views. That is a deliberate departure from how the rest of this package
// composes, and the reason is in the numbers — see [keyboardNode] — but the
// short version is that a keyboard is a grid of identical cells with no
// independent state, which is the one shape where a subtree per cell buys
// nothing and costs a build, a layout and a paint per cell.
//
// It draws nothing, occupies nothing and allocates nothing unless the kiosk
// switch is on *and* a field has asked for it; see [SetOnScreenKeyboard] and
// [gift.EventContext.RequestSoftKeyboard].
//
// # What it deliberately is not
//
// It is not an IME. Section 14 excludes CJK composition, a preedit string and
// a candidate window, and a German layout is none of those: every key here
// produces one finished character, exactly as a physical German keyboard does.
//
// There are no long press accents. [gift.EventLongPress] exists and would be
// the hook, but an accent popup is a second floating surface with its own
// geometry, its own hit testing and its own dismissal rules, and the German
// layout it would serve already has ä, ö, ü and ß on keys of their own. It is
// the feature to build when a layout needs it.
//
// There is no arrow key, no tab and no modifier other than shift. A caret is
// placed by touching the text, which [TextFieldView] already supports, and a
// kiosk form is walked with the fingers rather than with tab.
//
// # Keeping the field clear of it
//
// The overlay does most of it. A [ZStack] — and so a [Window] — that has this
// view as a direct child lays the other children out in the part of the box
// the keyboard leaves free while it is showing; see [Overlay.AvoidKeyboard].
// The viewport of a scrolling form really is shorter then, so the ordinary
// reveal of [gift.App.ScrollIntoView] is exact, a field in the last row of a
// form can be lifted like any other, and a button pinned to the bottom of the
// screen sits on top of the keys instead of under them. It is the composition
// of a column,
//
//	ui.VStack(ui.VScroll(form).Flex(1), ui.OnScreenKeyboard())
//
// without having to restructure the application around the keyboard, and the
// column still works unchanged: the keyboard takes the height it needs and
// there is nothing for it to cover.
//
// Section 19 names [gift.App.ScrollIntoView] as the mechanism, and it is still
// the one that moves the field. The field asks to be revealed from its own
// focus handler, before the keyboard was built; gift re-runs the reveal on the
// frame after the keyboard appeared, when the layout has already shrunk the
// content, which is the order that makes the second reveal see the final
// viewport.
//
// # The obstruction, for the compositions that overlap
//
// This view also declares [gift.Element.Obstructs], so a reveal aims at the
// part of a scroll container the keyboard is not sitting on. With avoidance on
// that never changes anything — the viewport ends where the keyboard begins —
// and it is there for the two compositions in which the keyboard does cover
// the content: [Overlay.AvoidKeyboard] turned off, and a keyboard wrapped in
// another container, which the overlay cannot recognise.
//
// Those keep the limit the obstruction has always had, and it is arithmetic:
// **a container can only lift the field by as much as it can still scroll**,
// and it can only scroll while there is content left below. A field that is
// the last row of a form stays at the bottom of the viewport with the keyboard
// over it, unless the form leaves room under it:

// [gift.EventContext.KeyDown] and [gift.EventContext.KeyUp], which are the
// same three entry points backend/ebiten calls for a physical keyboard. The
// event is built by gift, delivered to whatever holds the focus and bubbled
// up its ancestors exactly like any other, so no widget can distinguish the
// two and none of them needs a second code path. That is the whole design and
// it is why the test for it asserts on the *field's value*: there is no signal
// to assert on.
//
// A command key sends its press on pointer down and its release on pointer up,
