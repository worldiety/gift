//
// # Why [App.Invalidate] is not enough, and when that matters
//
// Invalidate marks the root scope. A plain [Component] has no rebuild boundary
// — its props live in a closure gift cannot compare — so a root rebuild does
// reach every plain component under it. A [Memo] is exactly the thing that
// stops it: [App.updateChild] returns without calling the component function
// when the props are equal and no state the instance read has fired, which is
// the boundary section 6 of the project plan asks for. A change that is
// neither a prop nor a state, but which nevertheless decides what the subtree
// looks like, therefore does not reach it.
//
// The change that is like that today is the colour theme. Colours are resolved
// during build and stored literally in the retained node — that is what keeps
// the frame path free of theme lookups — so a subtree which is not rebuilt
// keeps the palette it was built with. The result on a screen is not subtle:
// the background turns light while every memoised card stays dark, and the
// text on it becomes unreadable. [ui.SetTheme] calls this method for that
// reason.
//
// # The cost, stated plainly
//
// One walk of the retained tree, which is O(nodes) and allocates nothing, plus
// a rebuild of every component instance in the next update — which is the most
// expensive update the application can have, and is exactly what "every colour
// on the screen is resolved again" means. It is the right price for a theme
// switch, which happens when a person presses a button, and it would be the
// wrong price for anything per frame. Nothing in gift calls it from the frame
// path, and nothing should.
//
// The blunter alternatives were weighed and rejected. Making the theme a
// [State] that every widget reads would put a dependency registration on every
// colour lookup, in ui, which has no [Context] to register against; a
// generation counter compared during reconciliation would have to be consulted
// for every node in the tree, once per update, to save work in the one update
// per hour where a theme changes. This is the cheap version of the honest
