	OpGlyphs
	// OpShadow fills Bounds with Color through a Gaussian falloff of
	// standard deviation Blur/2, with corners rounded by CornerRadius.
	//
	// Bounds is the *shape*, not the painted area: the offset and the spread
	// of a [Shadow] are already folded into it by the producer, and the blur
	// is carried separately so that the backend can grow the geometry by
	// exactly as much as it needs. See [Op.PaintBounds].
	//
	// A Blur of zero or less is a hard edged rounded fill, which is what a
	// shadow with a spread and an offset but no blur is. StrokeWidth is
	// ignored: a shadow is never stroked.
	OpShadow
	// OpImage draws the image resource named by Image into Bounds, modulated
	// by Color, with its corners rounded by CornerRadius.
	//
	// The mapping is selected by Fit; see [ImageFit]. The zero value stretches
	// the full texture onto Bounds, which is the obvious affine mapping and
	// what this operation did before it had a Fit at all. There is still no
	// general source rectangle in an operation, and that remains a decision
	// with a reason rather than an omission: four more float32 would grow
	// every operation of every list by sixteen bytes, and what a source
	// rectangle is wanted for is expressible without it:
	//
	//   - Letterboxing is a *smaller Bounds*. The producer knows the aspect
	//     ratio of the picture it asked for, so it computes the fitted
	//     rectangle and emits that.
	//   - Cropping to fill is [ImageCover]: Bounds is the rectangle the
	//     picture is seen in and the backend crops the texture symmetrically,
	//     with the arithmetic of [ImageFit.Source].
	//   - Any other crop is a *clip*. The producer pushes the visible
	//     rectangle, emits an oversized Bounds and pops. The backend clips
	//     exactly, at vertex level, interpolating the texture coordinates
	//     along with the corners.
	//
	// Cropping to fill used to be the clip of the last item, and [ImageFit]
	// records why it no longer is: a clip cannot carry the rounded corners of
	// the rectangle the picture is seen in.
	//
	// # Rounded corners
	//
	// CornerRadius rounds Bounds exactly as it rounds an [OpFillRoundRect]:
	// the same clamp to half the smaller edge, the same antialiased edge one
	// device pixel wide, centred on the boundary. So a rounded picture and a
	// rounded fill of the same Bounds and radius cover the same pixels to the
	// same degree, which is what lets a placeholder turn into its picture
	// without changing shape, and what lets an [OpStrokeRoundRect] of the same
	// Bounds and radius sit on its edge: the outer contour of the stroke is the
	// contour of the picture, and its inner contour is the concentric one of
	// radius max(0, CornerRadius-StrokeWidth).
	//
	// Rounding is a property of this operation and not a clip. A rounded clip
	// would have to be intersected with every enclosing clip, and two rounded
	// rectangles do not intersect to a rounded rectangle; the picture, on the
	// other hand, knows its own shape. A radius of zero or less is the plain
	// textured quad, which is cheaper to shade; see the backend.
	//
	// Color is a *tint*, premultiplied like every other colour here. Opaque
	// white leaves the picture alone; a lower alpha fades it over whatever is
	// behind it, which is how a cross fade or a disabled state is drawn
	// without a second material. A fully transparent colour skips the
	// operation. StrokeWidth and Blur are ignored.
	OpImage
	// OpMaterial declares a material region: a background whose appearance
	// depends on what was drawn before it. Bounds is the region, CornerRadius
	// its shape and Material the index of its parameters in the material side
	// table of the owning list; see [List.AddMaterial].
	//
	// # It is a barrier, and that is its whole meaning
	//
	// A material reads its backdrop, and the backdrop is *everything emitted
	// earlier in this list and nothing else* — not the material, not its
	// children, not a sibling that comes after it. The display list has no
	// separate z field and needs none: emission order is z order, so
	// "earlier" is a position in the slice and the dependency is expressed by
	// the operation's own index. That is the "Z-Reihenfolge und
	// Hintergrundabhaengigkeiten" of the project plan, section 8, and it is
	// also why a backend cannot batch across one: every operation before it
	// has to have reached the target before its backdrop can be sampled.
	//
	// The consequence a producer has to honour is the drawing order of a
	// styled node — shadow, background or material, content, border. A
	// painter that emitted its children first and its material second would
	// be asking for a backdrop that contains its own content, and nothing in
	// the list could tell the difference.
	//
	// Color, StrokeWidth, Blur, Glyphs and GlyphCount are ignored: every
	// number a material needs is in its side table entry, because there are
	// six of them and a [Glass] may grow a seventh.
	OpMaterial

	// OpLayer opens a cached layer: the next GlyphCount operations belong to
	// a subtree that the backend may rasterise once into a texture of its
	// own and afterwards composite as a single picture. See [List.BeginLayer].
	//
	// Bounds is the layer in the space of Xform, which together with Clip
	// is the transform and clip the *composite* is drawn with. Image is the
	// layer key, stable for as long as the subtree lives. The operations of
	// the layer are expressed in layer space – see [LayerXform] – so that
	// moving the layer, as a page transition does, leaves them unchanged and
	// the texture reusable.
	//
	// Two fields are reused rather than added, so that no other operation
	// grows: GlyphCount is the number of operations in the layer and
	// StrokeWidth the scale they were emitted at. [Op.LayerOps] and
	// [Op.LayerScale] read them under their real names.

)

// Op is a single drawing operation.
//
// It is plain old data on purpose: no pointers, no slices, no interfaces and
// no maps. Operations live in one flat, reused slice inside a [List], so a
// frame that emits the same operations as the previous one performs no
// allocation at all.
//
// Clip and Xform are indices into the side tables of the owning list rather
// than embedded values, because most operations share the clip and the
// transform of their neighbours and copying a rectangle and a matrix into
// every operation would triple the size of the list. Glyphs and GlyphCount
// follow the same pattern for the same reason, one step further: a text
// operation is a *range* in a third side table, because the number of glyphs
// is not bounded and a variable length payload cannot live in a fixed size
// struct.
//
// Size: 52 bytes before [OpGlyphs] existed, 60 after, 64 since [OpShadow],
// 68 since [OpImage].
// The eight bytes of OpGlyphs are the index and the count and buy every
// operation kind the same flat layout; the alternative, reusing CornerRadius
// and StrokeWidth as an untyped union, would have cost nothing and been a
// float32 quietly holding an array index.
//
// The four bytes of OpShadow are Blur, and they are a genuine four byte growth
// of every operation in every list. Reusing StrokeWidth would have been
// defensible — unlike the glyph index it is a length in the same units — but
// the two fields would then have had to be documented as "stroke width, except
// when it is a blur", and a shadow with a stroke is the sort of thing a later
// work unit asks for.
//
// The four bytes of [OpImage] are Image, and they cost the property that used
// to be worth stating here: sixty four was exactly one cache line, sixty eight
// is not, so an operation now straddles one every sixteenth element. The
// alternative was to overload Glyphs — an unused uint32 in an image operation,
// exactly as Blur is unused in a glyph operation — and it was rejected for the
// reason above, twice over: an image id in a field called Glyphs is a union
// with no tag but the kind, and the first reader to write l.Glyphs(op.Glyphs,
// op.GlyphCount) on an image operation gets a plausible looking slice of
// somebody else's text. The measured cost of the growth is in
// BenchmarkFramePathWithImages: the list is a few per cent larger and the
// frame path is still 0 B/op, because the slice is reused and never grows
// again after the first frames.
//
// The four bytes of [OpMaterial] are Material, and they take the struct from
// 68 to 72 bytes. Measured with unsafe.Sizeof in TestOpIsStillPlainOldData,
// which pins the number so that the next field is a decision and not an
// accident. (This note used to name a TestOpSize that never existed.)
//
// This one was worth arguing about, because a material operation is rare —
// one or two per frame against hundreds of fills — and four bytes on every
// operation to serve it is the worst ratio in the struct. Three alternatives
// were considered and rejected:
//
//   - Reusing Glyphs, as an image id could have been. Rejected for the reason
//     already recorded above: a field called Glyphs holding something else is
//     a union with no tag, and the first reader to call l.Glyphs on it gets a
//     plausible looking slice of somebody else's text.
//   - Putting the six glass parameters in Color, CornerRadius, StrokeWidth
//     and Blur, which between them hold seven floats. It fits today and only
//     today: Color would have had to mean "tint", StrokeWidth "refraction"
//     and Blur "blur radius, but a radius here and a diameter on a shadow".
//     Section 8 already calls the material experimental, which is the
//     opposite of a reason to freeze its parameter count into the operation
//     struct.
//   - A separate parallel slice indexed by operation number. That is the
//     same four bytes per operation with an extra indirection and an
//     invariant nobody can see.
//
// The cost is measured rather than assumed: BenchmarkFramePath is unchanged at
// 0 B/op, and a frame of a thousand operations grew from 68 to 72 kilobytes of
// reused backing array.
//
// Fit, the crop mode of [OpImage], did not grow it: it is one byte in the
// padding after Kind. See [ImageFit] for why it had to exist.
